00:00:07.072 --> 00:00:09.834 line:100% position:50% align:middle
All right, now we're going
to learn about ejecting.

00:00:09.834 --> 00:00:12.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So far in this application,
we've been using something called Create

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
React App. And what that does is, it tucks
away all of the hard parts of all of the

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
tooling behind building a React
application, and it does it all for you.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if you've ever tried to build a
modern JavaScript application,

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you know that you can sometimes wake up 10
hours later just rocking on the ground,

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
being, like, "Why are there so many
Webpack files and what is Babel?

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
What's the difference between a preset and
a plugin, and which one do I need?

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And I have six different boilerplates, and
nothing works. I just want to write some

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.372 line:100% position:50% align:middle
JavaScript." And it's the most
frustrating thing around.

00:00:47.372 --> 00:00:51.234 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So what Create React App does is
it takes all of that stuff, it builds you

00:00:51.234 --> 00:00:55.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a really nice sort of, like, common
default, and it puts it behind its own

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
package called "react-scripts."
Now, that is great because we have gone

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this whole tutorial learning with it. But
you might be asking,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Okay, I want to do a little bit something
custom. I know a little bit about Webpack.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
How do I get a custom ESLint set up? How
do I customize my Webpack setup?

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
How do I do custom Babel plugins?"
And if you need to do that,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and when you need to do that, what you
need to do is eject from Create React App.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.386 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we're going to go from no longer just
having this tidy little source directory

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:30.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in our baby little Public folder with
an Index and an Icon in it.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And it's going to actually give us
everything. So ejecting is one-way,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can't kind of un-eject, so what I like
to tell people to do is just do this on a

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
branch in Git. So I just created a new Git
repository here, and I'm going to check

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
out a new branch called "ejected." Just so
that if I want to un-eject,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I can go back. I can roll that branch
back. And then what we want to run,

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you look at "package.json," you'll see
that there is an eject here,

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we simply just run "npm run eject."
Are you ready? Five, four,

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
no, I'm just kidding. Here we go! And do
you want to eject? Of course,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we do. And then it is going to give us all
of the dependency files as well as install

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all of the dependencies that we need for
this to work. When it has finished we can

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
type "git status" and it will show us that
we've edited "package.json" as well as

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
added two new folders, "config" and
"scripts." Let's take a quick look.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Open "package.json" first, and you'll
notice that, holy smokes,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
look at all of this new stuff that has
been added. There's probably about 30 or

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
40 lines of other dependencies, and this
stuff is not new. It was just previously

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
tucked away in the React scripts for us,
so we don't have to worry about what the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:55.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
heck is "gzip-size" and "rimraf" and
"extract-text-webpack-plugin," and all of

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.180 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that stuff. So what this doing is it's
allowing us to use Babel,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
ESLint, Webpack, Webpack Dev Server, as
well as all of the loading that we need

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
behind the scenes.
So when we've ejected, we have this

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
external Webpack file. You can open that
up. You can just take a look at,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"How does Webpack work?" I'm not going to
go through all of it,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just because that's an entire series in
itself. However, if you wanted to add

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
something, like maybe you want to add your
own SASS loading, or you want to add

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
inline styles, or your own dev server, or
some sort of reloading that you wish to

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
use, you can edit the Webpack file here
and you'll have a little bit more control

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
over how it works. I generally like to
stay with Create React App as long as I

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
possibly can, because it just gets out of
your way. And then it's sort of nice if

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you do need a little bit more control. You
can eject and get access to this really

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
well-built Webpack setup. And it's not
like you're going to write this thing from

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
scratch, but you can tweak a few things
here or there. Another thing in your

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.481 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"package.json" is it also gives you access
to your ESLint commands here.

00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:02.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And if you have some custom ESLint rules,
which a lot of developers do,

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
then you can add them to the
"package.json." It was recently taken out

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of the "eslintrc" file into
"package.json." There's some stuff around

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
testing here with Jest, which is what a
lot of people use to test the React

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
components, as well as has all of your
Babel presets. So maybe you wanted to try

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
out some of the experimental Babel preset
features. What you could is you can add

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stage one or stage zero
to this, no problem.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So Create React App, really nice for just
getting up and running,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you can eject if you need a little bit
more control. So that is it!

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Whoo, what a series! I want to thank you
so much for joining me in learning React.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I hope that you learned a lot. I hope that
you really understand how React works,

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you're excited to go build more. If
you've got any feedback or any questions,

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.775 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or if you have some ideas as to what you'd
like to see from me next in terms of

00:04:52.775 --> 00:04:57.559 line:100% position:50% align:middle
tutorial, please feel free to hit
me up on the chat or anything like that.

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:00.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I would love to hear from you.
Other than that, thanks again,

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and I'll see you in the next video.
