Before we get into events, I want to talk
real quick about something called helper

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:13.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
functions. And this is not specific
to React, it's just sort of something

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in JavaScript. If we take a look at... I
finished an example here,

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to load in some fishes. There's
some helper functions that I use

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all throughout the app. So as we
store the data, it's stored in cents.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
However, when you want to display how much
that thing is, we want to convert that

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to dollars and cents, and format it all
nicely with the dollar sign,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and it does all the rounding and all the
good stuff. And when you add multiple,

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going to add them all up. So when I
have some specific functionality that is

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not necessarily tied to one of my
components, because I'm using them all

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.270 line:100% position:50% align:middle
throughout the application, I
like to create what is called a helper's

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
file, and in this helper's file I just
stick little handy functions that,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they're not a module, they're not big
enough to be a module, but they're things

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that I'll use throughout my app.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So open up helpers.js, and I've provided
this to you already. Inside that we see

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there is a formatPrice(), there is a
rando function here that I am using

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.933 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for this down here where we have
getFunName(). What this does is it's

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.533 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to grab a couple of these
adjectives,

00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a couple of the nouns, and it's going
to come up with these really

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hilarious names like fierce
clumsy leaves, etc., etc.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that is my helper file, and in order
to access some of these functions

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that I need, right now we just need this
getFunName(), we want to open up our Store

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.748 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Picker, and we'll go down to this input
here. And we want to just set like a

00:01:34.748 --> 00:01:39.206 line:100% position:50% align:middle
default value that is in here when you
load the page. You're gonna have a

00:01:39.206 --> 00:01:44.754 line:100% position:50% align:middle
random one every single time that we do.
So rather than saying a value equals,

00:01:44.754 --> 00:01:47.377 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because a value is going to be tied
to something called 'state',

00:01:47.377 --> 00:01:48.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we don't actually want to do that

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
just yet. We just want to have a
default value when we load the page.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we want to have a "defaultValue =",
and we are going to run,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
again these curly brackets let us run
JavaScript inside of it.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to run getFunName().

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, where did getFunName() come from?
Well, we have to import it.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, import. And since this is not the
default export, so we're exporting this

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function getFunName(). We're not doing
export default getFunName().

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's just simply export getFunName(). And
that's what's called a Named Export

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in ES6. I have whole series on ES6 if you
want to learn more about all this stuff,

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but the short of it is that we need
to import getFunName() like this,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because it is a named import, and we want
to grab that from our helpers file.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's two levels up, and it's just
helpers like that.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now when we give this a save, and it
refreshes, there we go, now every time we

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
refresh, we're going to see a hilarious
jealous clumsy analysis.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
All of these, apologize if any of them are
offensive. I've seen a couple of them come

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
through that are just, out of the sheer
randomness of them, they become a little

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
bit offensive. But hopefully it makes
you laugh. It's always nice to have both

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
fun data that you're working with as well
as make it default. So you're not just

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
mashing the keyboard to make it work.
You want to have some nice stuff,

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"long-ugliest-potatoes."

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Cool. So in the next video what we're
gonna do is, when I hit the submit button,

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:23.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I want to then change the URL
to 'store/long-ugliest-potatoes'.
