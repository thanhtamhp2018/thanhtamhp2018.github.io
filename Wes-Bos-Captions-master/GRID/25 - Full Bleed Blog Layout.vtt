00:00:00.294 --> 00:00:03.806
(hard rock music)

2
00:00:03.806 --> 00:00:06.435
<v ->All right, in this one, we are going to be,</v>

3
00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:08.666
sort of, styling a different blog layout.

4
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.099
One of the, kinda, cool things about CSS Grid

5
00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.317
is that it's good for application and layout,

6
00:00:14.317 --> 00:00:17.512
but it's also good for just laying out text on a page.

7
00:00:17.512 --> 00:00:19.823
So, this is what we have here,

8
00:00:19.823 --> 00:00:21.591
where we've got some headings,

9
00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:23.138
we've got some paragraph texts,

10
00:00:23.138 --> 00:00:25.010
and then we have these things that I like to call tips,

11
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.159
where you can put them to the right or to the left.

12
00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:30.481
They've got some quotes, and some images,

13
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:31.624
that sort of spill out.

14
00:00:31.624 --> 00:00:33.173
I like to call this sort of full bleed.

15
00:00:33.173 --> 00:00:37.280
It goes all the way past where the text might be.

16
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.902
And you can put stuff to the left and to the right,

17
00:00:39.902 --> 00:00:41.149
and some bigger images.

18
00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.420
So, let's jump into it.

19
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.489
Let's take a quick look at what we've got here

20
00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:46.725
in the html.

21
00:00:46.725 --> 00:00:49.558
We'll go to full bleed blog start.

22
00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:53.016
And we've got an article, the class of post.

23
00:00:53.016 --> 00:00:53.849
And then, inside of that,

24
00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:57.526
we just have, like, a normal html that might be spit out by,

25
00:00:57.526 --> 00:01:01.500
like, a WordPress, or any other CMS that you might have.

26
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.538
The only, like, interesting thing is that

27
00:01:03.538 --> 00:01:05.463
we have these div with the class of tip.

28
00:01:05.463 --> 00:01:07.851
And it could be anything with the class of tip, actually,

29
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:09.684
but I'd like to put a paragraph tag inside of it,

30
00:01:09.684 --> 00:01:11.026
so I used a div.

31
00:01:11.026 --> 00:01:13.539
And then, tip and tip-right, or tip-left,

32
00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:14.959
and they will go across,

33
00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:19.081
and then we also have figures with images and figcaptions,

34
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:20.359
to the bottom of that.

35
00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:21.930
So, we'll open up the full bleed here,

36
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.860
and this is sort of what it looks like by default.

37
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.879
I've just styled the text to be specific black,

38
00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:29.962
and some metallics on the H1.

39
00:01:29.962 --> 00:01:32.379
So, the way it's going to work is that

40
00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:36.007
we are going to take the post, and make it a grid,

41
00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:38.160
and then we're gonna make it into three columns,

42
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.071
in that most of the content is going

43
00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:41.944
to take up the center column,

44
00:01:41.944 --> 00:01:43.741
that's what this text is going to be,

45
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:46.307
and then, occasionally, things, like images,

46
00:01:46.307 --> 00:01:50.285
are going to span themselves all three across.

47
00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:52.853
So, we'll go ahead and grab our post,

48
00:01:52.853 --> 00:01:56.129
and we'll display: grid right on that specific post.

49
00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:58.420
Let's also open up our dev tools here,

50
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.936
and turn on the grid dev tools for what we have.

51
00:02:01.936 --> 00:02:06.103
I'm gonna put a max width of 1000px on the container,

52
00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:08.929
and then I'm going to center it.

53
00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.006
I'm going to put 200 pixels on top and bottom,

54
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:13.078
and auto, we're gonna center it.

55
00:02:13.078 --> 00:02:14.765
There we go. Looking pretty good.

56
00:02:14.765 --> 00:02:17.415
Now we're gonna split this up into three columns,

57
00:02:17.415 --> 00:02:19.122
and if we look at what we got here,

58
00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:22.538
it's split up into, they're not perfectly columns,

59
00:02:22.538 --> 00:02:23.585
as I like to annoy people

60
00:02:23.585 --> 00:02:26.162
who like things perfectly centered.

61
00:02:26.162 --> 00:02:28.218
But we have a bit of a column here.

62
00:02:28.218 --> 00:02:29.694
You've got your main column here,

63
00:02:29.694 --> 00:02:30.897
and then a bit of one here.

64
00:02:30.897 --> 00:02:33.933
The way that I, sort of, did it initially was,

65
00:02:33.933 --> 00:02:35.944
I said grid-template-column,

66
00:02:35.944 --> 00:02:39.033
and I was like maybe the first will be 15 percent,

67
00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:42.200
and the second one will be 60 percent,

68
00:02:43.208 --> 00:02:46.323
and then the third one will be 25 percent,

69
00:02:46.323 --> 00:02:47.782
and we'll give that a save.

70
00:02:47.782 --> 00:02:49.911
And that will work pretty well.

71
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:52.648
The problems comes when you start to add grid-gap,

72
00:02:52.648 --> 00:02:54.344
where you wanna have 20px.

73
00:02:54.344 --> 00:02:56.393
Now, all of the sudden, we're over-budget.

74
00:02:56.393 --> 00:02:58.150
And if we start to resize this thing

75
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.098
to be a little bit smaller than 1000 pixels,

76
00:03:00.098 --> 00:03:02.424
we start to get this dreaded horizontal scroll.

77
00:03:02.424 --> 00:03:03.525
And why is that?

78
00:03:03.525 --> 00:03:06.340
Well, the reason behind that is because

79
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.738
we are adding up to a hundred percent,

80
00:03:08.738 --> 00:03:11.360
and then we're adding grid-gap of 20px,

81
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.067
and grid-gap works just like margin,

82
00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:14.310
where it will add to it.

83
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.402
It will not take away from these values.

84
00:03:16.402 --> 00:03:18.863
So, what we wanna do is actually switch these over

85
00:03:18.863 --> 00:03:20.634
to fr units.

86
00:03:20.634 --> 00:03:21.857
And I sort of just thought, oh!

87
00:03:21.857 --> 00:03:23.409
These are all kind of base five,

88
00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.742
so, 15 percent could really just be 3fr.

89
00:03:28.598 --> 00:03:29.889
And these things are just proportional,

90
00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.472
so I can do whatever I want.

91
00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:34.889
That will be 12fr, and this would be 5fr.

92
00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:38.257
And then everything will add up,

93
00:03:38.257 --> 00:03:41.794
regardless of how much grid-gap I actually end up adding.

94
00:03:41.794 --> 00:03:46.017
I'm actually going to add a grid-gap of 10px,

95
00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:47.184
and then 50px,

96
00:03:48.055 --> 00:03:50.686
so it's going to be 50 in between each of them,

97
00:03:50.686 --> 00:03:53.255
but the gap in between each of the rows

98
00:03:53.255 --> 00:03:55.207
is only going to be 10.

99
00:03:55.207 --> 00:03:56.040
Good.

100
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.873
Now, I've got this problem here

101
00:03:56.873 --> 00:03:59.450
where every single paragraph, or every single element,

102
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.615
is now taking up a spot.

103
00:04:01.615 --> 00:04:03.971
So what I really wanna do is

104
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:06.710
select all of the elements

105
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.329
and put them in this center column

106
00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.433
that we're looking for here.

107
00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:12.194
Let's go down here and grab the post,

108
00:04:12.194 --> 00:04:15.433
and grab every single item that is a direct child

109
00:04:15.433 --> 00:04:17.108
of our actual grid.

110
00:04:17.108 --> 00:04:19.281
And we'll say, grid-column,

111
00:04:19.281 --> 00:04:21.614
we're going to start at two,

112
00:04:22.885 --> 00:04:25.223
and we're going to span one,

113
00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:27.530
and that should put them all in the actual center column.

114
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.846
See, that's looking a lot better.

115
00:04:28.846 --> 00:04:30.343
Alternatively, what you can also do is

116
00:04:30.343 --> 00:04:33.878
you could say two, and then end two from the end,

117
00:04:33.878 --> 00:04:35.416
and that's the exact same thing.

118
00:04:35.416 --> 00:04:37.929
I think I might even prefer that,

119
00:04:37.929 --> 00:04:40.427
in that, we'll just say, don't end right here,

120
00:04:40.427 --> 00:04:41.400
but end right here.

121
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.551
And if I were to ever add another column of like 4fr,

122
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:46.827
that will then span.

123
00:04:46.827 --> 00:04:48.419
See, now, it will span the two,

124
00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:49.760
and leave this extra tip.

125
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.593
Because really,

126
00:04:50.593 --> 00:04:52.863
I just want these two gutters on the left and the right,

127
00:04:52.863 --> 00:04:55.492
and then I want all of the content to take up

128
00:04:55.492 --> 00:04:56.996
whatever is in between.

129
00:04:56.996 --> 00:05:00.371
So I like this sort of anchoring off the end there,

130
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:03.712
instead of assuming that it's always going to be a one.

131
00:05:03.712 --> 00:05:07.379
So, we've got all of our items working here.

132
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.875
Let's start working with some of these figures here.

133
00:05:11.875 --> 00:05:14.046
So, if we were to find one of them.

134
00:05:14.046 --> 00:05:14.985
This is a figure.

135
00:05:14.985 --> 00:05:17.114
I want it to span all the way across.

136
00:05:17.114 --> 00:05:19.697
So, I'm gonna say .post&gt;figure,

137
00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:23.350
and let's first take the margin off of it.

138
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.683
Get rid of that.

139
00:05:25.807 --> 00:05:28.635
And then, I'm going to make it span all the way across.

140
00:05:28.635 --> 00:05:32.657
So we'll say grid-column: 1/-1,

141
00:05:32.657 --> 00:05:35.109
and that will make it span all the way across,

142
00:05:35.109 --> 00:05:38.156
and get this nice, super-wide image.

143
00:05:38.156 --> 00:05:41.437
I'll also grab the figcaption.

144
00:05:41.437 --> 00:05:45.600
Just make that font size 10. Make it look nice and small.

145
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.433
You could also,

146
00:05:46.433 --> 00:05:48.632
if these images are a loading slowly for you,

147
00:05:48.632 --> 00:05:50.329
it seems my Internet's a little bit slow right now,

148
00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:52.138
you could just save them locally,

149
00:05:52.138 --> 00:05:54.239
and then they'll load nice and quick.

150
00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:57.236
All right, let's go on next to these block quotes

151
00:05:57.236 --> 00:05:58.275
that we've got here.

152
00:05:58.275 --> 00:06:00.976
So we've got, if we inspect them,

153
00:06:00.976 --> 00:06:02.218
let's see, we have these block quotes,

154
00:06:02.218 --> 00:06:05.449
and I want them to span all the way across, as well.

155
00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.794
So we'll say, .post &gt; blockquote.

156
00:06:08.794 --> 00:06:12.508
I also want them to span the same as the figure tag.

157
00:06:12.508 --> 00:06:13.612
And there, there we go!

158
00:06:13.612 --> 00:06:17.139
And then we also wanna bump up the font size

159
00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:17.972
on each of those.

160
00:06:17.972 --> 00:06:20.305
So we'll say, font-size: 60,

161
00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:26.039
font-style, text-align: center, and margin:0.

162
00:06:27.047 --> 00:06:29.626
Beautiful! Looking good!

163
00:06:29.626 --> 00:06:31.855
Now, we've got these tips here,

164
00:06:31.855 --> 00:06:34.287
which need to go onto the left or to the right.

165
00:06:34.287 --> 00:06:36.385
And, what they should do is they should just go

166
00:06:36.385 --> 00:06:39.789
into the actual gutter of what, like,

167
00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:42.646
right, if it were left, it should go right here,

168
00:06:42.646 --> 00:06:44.626
and if it was right, it should go here.

169
00:06:44.626 --> 00:06:46.253
So, let's first grab those tips.

170
00:06:46.253 --> 00:06:48.260
So the tip, and the background,

171
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.010
let's just do FAFAFA.

172
00:06:51.181 --> 00:06:52.571
Good!

173
00:06:52.571 --> 00:06:56.160
And we'll add some padding of 10px to that.

174
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.210
Now, how do we get it to go to the left or the right?

175
00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.127
So let's do the right ones first.

176
00:07:00.127 --> 00:07:01.146
So, .tip, actually,

177
00:07:01.146 --> 00:07:02.584
let's just do whatever this one is.

178
00:07:02.584 --> 00:07:03.810
Let's see.

179
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:04.643
Left.

180
00:07:04.643 --> 00:07:05.810
So, .tip-left.

181
00:07:07.712 --> 00:07:10.052
We wanna say grid-column,

182
00:07:10.052 --> 00:07:13.567
we wanna start at one, and go for one, right?

183
00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:16.187
Because we wanna start right here,

184
00:07:16.187 --> 00:07:18.965
and go just for one space wide.

185
00:07:18.965 --> 00:07:20.183
And now, you see,

186
00:07:20.183 --> 00:07:22.421
what happens is it will put it in the gutter,

187
00:07:22.421 --> 00:07:25.268
and because this is now an open space,

188
00:07:25.268 --> 00:07:29.695
and we have asked that our paragraph tags go in that space,

189
00:07:29.695 --> 00:07:32.231
the browser'll say, "Ooh! That's an empty space.

190
00:07:32.231 --> 00:07:33.354
"Don't mind if I do!

191
00:07:33.354 --> 00:07:36.147
"I'll go ahead and use that myself."

192
00:07:36.147 --> 00:07:40.313
So, on the left, we'll also do text-align: right,

193
00:07:40.313 --> 00:07:44.146
and we'll say border-right: 2px solid, yellow.

194
00:07:46.081 --> 00:07:47.069
Looking good.

195
00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:50.551
Now, let's find another one of these tips,

196
00:07:50.551 --> 00:07:53.091
that goes on the right-hand side.

197
00:07:53.091 --> 00:07:54.841
I think there is one,

198
00:07:56.708 --> 00:07:57.541
there we go.

199
00:07:57.541 --> 00:07:58.865
This song is by Levi the Poet.

200
00:07:58.865 --> 00:08:01.032
So, we'll grab .tip-right,

201
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.780
grid-column,

202
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.438
and, in this case, we want it to span one,

203
00:08:12.438 --> 00:08:15.300
but end at the last column,

204
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.974
and then that will anchor it to the right-hand side,

205
00:08:18.974 --> 00:08:22.048
and then we can take the, it's kinda the same idea,

206
00:08:22.048 --> 00:08:25.322
but put the border on the left-hand side.

207
00:08:25.322 --> 00:08:26.218
Beautiful!

208
00:08:26.218 --> 00:08:27.557
And, I think we had one more.

209
00:08:27.557 --> 00:08:28.784
This had an image in it,

210
00:08:28.784 --> 00:08:32.089
and it seems to automatically be styling itself.

211
00:08:32.089 --> 00:08:33.808
One thing that is,

212
00:08:33.808 --> 00:08:35.689
kinda weird with this,

213
00:08:35.689 --> 00:08:37.713
if one of these is really high,

214
00:08:37.713 --> 00:08:40.380
like, let's search for bandcamp,

215
00:08:41.426 --> 00:08:44.513
and put, like, a whole bunch of text in there,

216
00:08:44.513 --> 00:08:45.846
you'll notice that,

217
00:08:45.846 --> 00:08:49.533
it'll sort of force this to have a lot of empty space,

218
00:08:49.533 --> 00:08:51.206
and that's sort of just how grid works.

219
00:08:51.206 --> 00:08:53.623
But one thing you could do is

220
00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:55.730
if you know that you're not going to have

221
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.105
a bunch of tips one after another,

222
00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:02.745
you could also make these tips span a couple rows each.

223
00:09:02.745 --> 00:09:05.238
So we'll take the post.

224
00:09:05.238 --> 00:09:09.630
So we'll take a tip, and any tip will have a grid row,

225
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.378
and we'll just say a span like, span 3,

226
00:09:12.378 --> 00:09:13.211
and what that will do is

227
00:09:13.211 --> 00:09:15.211
it will span three high.

228
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:18.658
In this case, it's still not looking all that great.

229
00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:22.434
So, I don't know, (laughs) you can span even more than that.

230
00:09:22.434 --> 00:09:25.032
But, it's still is going to force the height.

231
00:09:25.032 --> 00:09:27.352
And if there is not enough space,

232
00:09:27.352 --> 00:09:31.695
it will simply just keep the text working while.

233
00:09:31.695 --> 00:09:32.732
So here, it looks pretty good,

234
00:09:32.732 --> 00:09:36.899
with the exception of the fact that it's really really high.

235
00:09:37.752 --> 00:09:39.150
But that's easy to fix,

236
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.317
because we can just say something like align-self: start,

237
00:09:44.878 --> 00:09:45.961
and then,

238
00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:48.188
that will only go as high as it actually needs to,

239
00:09:48.188 --> 00:09:49.861
instead of stretching high.

240
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:51.182
So, that's a bit of a,

241
00:09:51.182 --> 00:09:52.151
that's a okay solution.

242
00:09:52.151 --> 00:09:53.922
I'm not totally sold on that,

243
00:09:53.922 --> 00:09:57.271
but it's looking pretty good, in my case there.

244
00:09:57.271 --> 00:09:59.861
You could also, probably, absolute position them,

245
00:09:59.861 --> 00:10:02.771
if you know that they're not gonna over lap each other.

246
00:10:02.771 --> 00:10:06.388
So, we've got our quotes going all the way across.

247
00:10:06.388 --> 00:10:08.918
We got our images going all the way across.

248
00:10:08.918 --> 00:10:10.827
We've got our tips going in the left and the right,

249
00:10:10.827 --> 00:10:12.451
and then we have all of our, sort of,

250
00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:15.656
main reading content going down this main column here.

251
00:10:15.656 --> 00:10:17.701
And, this is a layout that I really like,

252
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:20.732
because any time that you wanna be able to have

253
00:10:20.732 --> 00:10:22.921
just a bit of a different reading experience,

254
00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:25.669
there's no need to put in all these extra elements,

255
00:10:25.669 --> 00:10:29.658
and all these extra divs, and wrap it around,

256
00:10:29.658 --> 00:10:31.732
or even if you have something like WordPress,

257
00:10:31.732 --> 00:10:33.077
and you were to tell the client,

258
00:10:33.077 --> 00:10:34.953
"Make sure you wrap this in a div,"

259
00:10:34.953 --> 00:10:37.837
(laughs) not gonna be able to necessarily do that.

260
00:10:37.837 --> 00:10:40.224
So, having CSS Grid,

261
00:10:40.224 --> 00:10:42.114
and being able to span it across

262
00:10:42.114 --> 00:10:43.856
or whenever it is that you need, sort of,

263
00:10:43.856 --> 00:10:46.429
default all of the text is in the middle column.

264
00:10:46.429 --> 00:10:48.065
But if you want to span something across,

265
00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:49.802
or you wanna stick something in the gutter,

266
00:10:49.802 --> 00:10:51.815
it's pretty simple to do that.

267
00:10:51.815 --> 00:10:53.351
So, hopefully, you enjoyed that one.
