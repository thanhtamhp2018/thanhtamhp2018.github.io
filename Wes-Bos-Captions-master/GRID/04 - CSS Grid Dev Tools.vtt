00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.417
(rock music)

2
00:00:03.468 --> 00:00:05.340
<v Instructor>CSS Grid is kinda hard to visualize,</v>

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.666
because we're essentially making these things called

4
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.578
columns and tracks and rows, and gaps,

5
00:00:10.578 --> 00:00:13.608
and they're not elements in themselves,

6
00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:16.409
like most things else in HTML,

7
00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:18.406
we're able to inspect element and change the color

8
00:00:18.406 --> 00:00:19.810
of it or add a border,

9
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.423
but with CSS Grid we're making these things

10
00:00:22.423 --> 00:00:24.501
that are sorta untouchable, so,

11
00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:26.594
what we need to do is use dev tools

12
00:00:26.594 --> 00:00:30.587
in order to get a better idea of what's actually going on.

13
00:00:30.587 --> 00:00:32.147
So open up 04 Dev Tools,

14
00:00:32.147 --> 00:00:35.111
and I've got the starter files open up in here.

15
00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:37.347
And this is just our standard div class container,

16
00:00:37.347 --> 00:00:38.880
we got our 10 items in here,

17
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.724
and I went ahead and display grid on the container.

18
00:00:41.724 --> 00:00:43.286
Now, what I want you to do is to

19
00:00:43.286 --> 00:00:47.824
inspect element and in your Firefox dev tools

20
00:00:47.824 --> 00:00:51.635
you are going to see a tab here called layout.

21
00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:53.648
It doesn't matter which item you've actually selected,

22
00:00:53.648 --> 00:00:55.963
but, actually you can click on the container,

23
00:00:55.963 --> 00:00:58.678
you can see that there's this little grid here,

24
00:00:58.678 --> 00:01:00.654
and you can either click that,

25
00:01:00.654 --> 00:01:03.514
and that will turn on and off the grid highlighting,

26
00:01:03.514 --> 00:01:05.854
or you can go over to the layout tab,

27
00:01:05.854 --> 00:01:09.454
and you see that it will automatically

28
00:01:09.454 --> 00:01:11.514
compile all of the different grids

29
00:01:11.514 --> 00:01:12.659
that are in here.

30
00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.206
Now again, the one that we have here is

31
00:01:15.206 --> 00:01:18.417
the container, the only reason all these other items

32
00:01:18.417 --> 00:01:20.081
are showing up is because I've also

33
00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:22.810
displayed grid them in our base CSS, so,

34
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.799
no need to worry about those just for now.

35
00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.997
Now what we can do is go ahead and turn on

36
00:01:26.997 --> 00:01:29.350
the visual grid that we have there,

37
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.183
and you'll see right away

38
00:01:32.183 --> 00:01:34.953
that we've got some lines over-lapping

39
00:01:34.953 --> 00:01:37.098
on top of our grid.

40
00:01:37.098 --> 00:01:38.683
And this is going to help us understand

41
00:01:38.683 --> 00:01:41.051
where the tracks are, where the columns are,

42
00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:43.935
where all the different rows are.

43
00:01:43.935 --> 00:01:45.859
Now there's a couple settings that we can have here,

44
00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:47.705
we can first turn on the line numbers,

45
00:01:47.705 --> 00:01:49.942
and you'll likely always want to have those on.

46
00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:52.023
Because when we get into placing items,

47
00:01:52.023 --> 00:01:53.555
that's gonna be really helpful.

48
00:01:53.555 --> 00:01:56.142
Area names, you can turn that on or off.

49
00:01:56.142 --> 00:01:58.263
We don't have any area names yet,

50
00:01:58.263 --> 00:02:00.081
we're gonna be learning that in coming videos.

51
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:02.267
And then finally you can extend the lines indefinitely,

52
00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:06.270
so if you want to extend them white off.

53
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.596
Sometimes they're a little bit hard to see

54
00:02:08.596 --> 00:02:10.313
over top of what you've got,

55
00:02:10.313 --> 00:02:13.031
and you can change the color of the items here.

56
00:02:13.031 --> 00:02:14.030
Just click on that.

57
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.539
I've found that if you make them black

58
00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:19.711
that's the easiest to see in all types of color,

59
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:21.518
obviously unless your grid is black.

60
00:02:21.518 --> 00:02:22.911
You can change it up.

61
00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:25.199
One other little tip that I've found

62
00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:27.265
in order to be able to see them,

63
00:02:27.265 --> 00:02:29.477
especially when we get into what do these mean,

64
00:02:29.477 --> 00:02:33.294
is I turn on the OSX accessibility zooming,

65
00:02:33.294 --> 00:02:35.599
so I could just do zoom in and out,

66
00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.615
wee-ooo, zoom in and out nice and quick like that.

67
00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:40.695
Good, so let's actually go ahead and start

68
00:02:40.695 --> 00:02:41.917
making some columns.

69
00:02:41.917 --> 00:02:43.191
We'll leave this open,

70
00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:45.531
and we'll sorta see how it adjusts in real time.

71
00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:48.391
So let's go and make some columns first.

72
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:50.951
You can see that we really only have one column.

73
00:02:50.951 --> 00:02:53.916
So say grid, template, column.

74
00:02:53.916 --> 00:02:55.164
And we'll have 100 pixels,

75
00:02:55.164 --> 00:02:58.181
and 200 pixels, and see what we've got there.

76
00:02:58.181 --> 00:03:00.899
Good, so now you see that we have our first column,

77
00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:02.459
our second column, and all of our rows

78
00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.173
are automatically being put in there.

79
00:03:05.173 --> 00:03:08.021
So first of all, one thing we need to note is that,

80
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.411
how come that we see three?

81
00:03:10.411 --> 00:03:13.039
Well you need to know that the columns

82
00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:15.289
and our rows, which are collectively referred to,

83
00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:16.485
what are they called?

84
00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:18.163
Tracks, they're all called tracks.

85
00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:21.491
Tracks are numbered not by the actual column itself,

86
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:25.075
but by the lines that start and stop them.

87
00:03:25.075 --> 00:03:27.196
So you're always gonna have one more number

88
00:03:27.196 --> 00:03:29.343
than you actually do column or rows.

89
00:03:29.343 --> 00:03:32.227
So, we can start at one, go to two, and go to three.

90
00:03:32.227 --> 00:03:34.267
Now you'll see that we have a bunch of

91
00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:36.983
actually different types of dots and lines

92
00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:38.647
and solid lines showing up here,

93
00:03:38.647 --> 00:03:40.508
and actually if we add some grid gap

94
00:03:40.508 --> 00:03:43.251
of 20px you'll see that we also have it.

95
00:03:43.251 --> 00:03:45.785
So what do these values actually mean?

96
00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:47.543
It's gonna be helpful to sorta

97
00:03:47.543 --> 00:03:49.349
hold these values in our head.

98
00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.557
Well, I made you another really nice diagram,

99
00:03:51.557 --> 00:03:54.833
if you open up today there's gonna be Line Meanings.png.

100
00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:56.057
Open that up,

101
00:03:56.057 --> 00:03:58.137
and you're going to see that

102
00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:01.153
the solid line, what that means is that

103
00:04:01.153 --> 00:04:05.129
that is the start and the stop of the explicit grid,

104
00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.067
and we don't know what that means yet,

105
00:04:07.067 --> 00:04:09.199
but we're gonna be doing it in just a second.

106
00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.177
The obviously the dashed diagonal lines

107
00:04:12.177 --> 00:04:13.260
mean the gap.

108
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:18.836
The dash lines means that it is an explicit track.

109
00:04:18.836 --> 00:04:20.861
So if I zoom really close in here,

110
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:24.397
you see that these dark dash lines

111
00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:26.269
are going vertically,

112
00:04:26.269 --> 00:04:29.999
and that's because we have explicitly created

113
00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:32.703
an actual column, right?

114
00:04:32.703 --> 00:04:34.395
Because we created a column here,

115
00:04:34.395 --> 00:04:36.329
and we said one will be 100,

116
00:04:36.329 --> 00:04:38.839
one will be 200, so that fact that they are

117
00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:42.306
dark dashed lines show us that we made those.

118
00:04:42.306 --> 00:04:44.067
On the flip side,

119
00:04:44.067 --> 00:04:46.861
we didn't create any type of rows here.

120
00:04:46.861 --> 00:04:48.823
They've all been created themselves.

121
00:04:48.823 --> 00:04:52.841
So if we zoom right in, you'll see that they are dotted.

122
00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:56.842
So I like to call these long ones dashed,

123
00:04:56.842 --> 00:04:59.067
and these sqaure ones dotted.

124
00:04:59.067 --> 00:05:01.576
And you see that they're a little bit more faint,

125
00:05:01.576 --> 00:05:03.161
they're a little bit see through.

126
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:05.151
And that means that they are implicit.

127
00:05:05.151 --> 00:05:06.413
Again, we'll go more into this,

128
00:05:06.413 --> 00:05:08.218
but that means that they have been created

129
00:05:08.218 --> 00:05:09.703
without us saying so,

130
00:05:09.703 --> 00:05:12.222
because the browser has created them.

131
00:05:12.222 --> 00:05:14.341
So, we'll come back to that quite a bit more,

132
00:05:14.341 --> 00:05:15.654
but it's helpful to know that

133
00:05:15.654 --> 00:05:17.461
all of these lines do mean something,

134
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:19.791
and having them open in your dev tools

135
00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:21.698
is going to be very helpful.

136
00:05:21.698 --> 00:05:22.842
So that's it for now,

137
00:05:22.842 --> 00:05:24.142
let's jump into the next video,

138
00:05:24.142 --> 00:05:25.989
which is actually understand the explicit

139
00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:28.656
and the implicit tracks in Grid.
