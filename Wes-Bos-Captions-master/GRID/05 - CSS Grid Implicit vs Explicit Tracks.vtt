<v Instructor>This video's gonna be</v>

3
00:00:04.494 --> 00:00:07.252
one of those fundamental understandings of CSS Grid,

4
00:00:07.252 --> 00:00:09.160
and it's something that's gonna keep coming up,

5
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.810
so let's make sure that we absolutely nail

6
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.956
this before we move on,

7
00:00:11.956 --> 00:00:14.464
and that is understanding the Implicit Grid,

8
00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:15.364
Implicit Tracks,

9
00:00:15.364 --> 00:00:18.222
and Explicit Tracks and the Explicit Grid,

10
00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:21.424
and how we can sort of use them together in order

11
00:00:21.424 --> 00:00:25.090
to make a really flexible and fluid-looking website,

12
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.547
so open up 05 and the starter file that we have there.

13
00:00:28.547 --> 00:00:30.763
I've got four items here, and I've displayed Gridit.

14
00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:33.919
Let's go ahead and turn on our Dev Tools here,

15
00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:35.750
so we can see how it's looking,

16
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.387
and I'm gonna make my tracks black.

17
00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:39.220
Good.

18
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.816
Now, let's go ahead and make sort of a two by two grid

19
00:00:41.816 --> 00:00:42.656
that we have there,

20
00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:44.893
first we'll put some gap on there,

21
00:00:44.893 --> 00:00:45.780
20 PX,

22
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.746
good,

23
00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:48.980
and then we'll add some columns,

24
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.897
let's do 200 pixels and 400 pixels,

25
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.252
now we've got a grid with two columns in it,

26
00:00:56.252 --> 00:00:57.797
and then we have two rows.

27
00:00:57.797 --> 00:01:00.054
So this is the difference between

28
00:01:00.054 --> 00:01:02.423
the explicit and the implicit,

29
00:01:02.423 --> 00:01:06.664
I have explicitly defined what the columns will be,

30
00:01:06.664 --> 00:01:10.333
and then I have not defined what the rows will be,

31
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.937
so those are what are called implicit,

32
00:01:12.937 --> 00:01:17.280
so if you do not create them they are called implicit,

33
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.733
meaning that the browser says

34
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:22.387
okay, well you've made two columns, great,

35
00:01:22.387 --> 00:01:23.935
I can put one and two there,

36
00:01:23.935 --> 00:01:26.320
but now I've got these extra elements left,

37
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.563
what do I do with them, right,

38
00:01:27.563 --> 00:01:29.291
like you can't just throw them out,

39
00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:30.693
they need to go somewhere,

40
00:01:30.693 --> 00:01:32.062
so what it will do,

41
00:01:32.062 --> 00:01:34.474
is it says okay well I have no more columns to put them in,

42
00:01:34.474 --> 00:01:37.912
so I might as well start to wrap onto the second line,

43
00:01:37.912 --> 00:01:40.744
and that will then create a row.

44
00:01:40.744 --> 00:01:43.022
So even though we did not define any rows here,

45
00:01:43.022 --> 00:01:45.984
they have been implicitly created,

46
00:01:45.984 --> 00:01:49.496
so if we then zoom in to see everything that we have,

47
00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:52.164
you'll see that the solid line means that

48
00:01:52.164 --> 00:01:55.944
that is where our explicit grid has been started,

49
00:01:55.944 --> 00:01:58.508
and then the dotted lines means that

50
00:01:58.508 --> 00:02:02.681
is where the explicit columns have been created,

51
00:02:02.681 --> 00:02:06.014
and then the dotted horizontal lines are

52
00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:07.946
a little bit lighter,

53
00:02:07.946 --> 00:02:10.516
and that means that they are implicitly created.

54
00:02:10.516 --> 00:02:11.956
Watch how that changes if we just,

55
00:02:11.956 --> 00:02:16.123
let's dupe this over and change it over to rows as well.

56
00:02:18.884 --> 00:02:20.940
And now you'll notice that if we zoom in,

57
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.378
first of all they are much bigger,

58
00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:25.566
because we have defined what the sizes

59
00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:27.188
of those rows will be,

60
00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:28.571
but now if we zoom in,

61
00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:31.255
you'll notice that the horizontal lines that we have

62
00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:35.024
in Dev Tools here are now solid and dashed,

63
00:02:35.024 --> 00:02:37.092
and not opaque and dotted,

64
00:02:37.092 --> 00:02:38.864
and that is because we have explicitly defined

65
00:02:38.864 --> 00:02:41.160
what they will look like.

66
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.252
If we scroll down here,

67
00:02:42.252 --> 00:02:44.100
you'll see also we have a solid line,

68
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.487
and that means that is where the explicit grid ends,

69
00:02:47.487 --> 00:02:51.654
so solid line is where the explicit grid starts and stops,

70
00:02:52.726 --> 00:02:55.116
so you can see that the column starts here,

71
00:02:55.116 --> 00:02:57.076
and the columns end here,

72
00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:58.592
and then up here,

73
00:02:58.592 --> 00:03:00.000
the column start here,

74
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.426
or sorry, the rows start here,

75
00:03:01.426 --> 00:03:03.442
and the rows end here,

76
00:03:03.442 --> 00:03:06.015
so this is a 100 percent explicit.

77
00:03:06.015 --> 00:03:09.575
Let's make these a little bit smaller in terms of rows,

78
00:03:09.575 --> 00:03:11.742
so maybe do 50 PX and 100 PX,

79
00:03:13.415 --> 00:03:14.935
now here's the big question,

80
00:03:14.935 --> 00:03:17.195
what happens if I now add a fifth

81
00:03:17.195 --> 00:03:19.278
and a sixth item to this?

82
00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.143
Wow, what just happened there?

83
00:03:23.143 --> 00:03:26.306
Well we only told it that we want two columns,

84
00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:27.995
just is fine,

85
00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:29.405
so one, two,

86
00:03:29.405 --> 00:03:32.708
but then we only sized two of the rows,

87
00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:34.508
however we have six items,

88
00:03:34.508 --> 00:03:38.438
so what's happening is that CSS Grid is going to say,

89
00:03:38.438 --> 00:03:41.521
okay I'm done with the explicit grid,

90
00:03:43.254 --> 00:03:46.402
see how this solid line ends right here,

91
00:03:46.402 --> 00:03:48.319
but I've got extra items,

92
00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.152
so it's then going to create a new row for us,

93
00:03:53.114 --> 00:03:55.334
and that is referred to as a what?

94
00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:57.088
An implicit row.

95
00:03:57.088 --> 00:03:57.987
Good.

96
00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:59.087
So we have gone over these,

97
00:03:59.087 --> 00:04:00.083
we've got our gap,

98
00:04:00.083 --> 00:04:01.586
we've got our grid template columns

99
00:04:01.586 --> 00:04:03.407
and our grid template rows,

100
00:04:03.407 --> 00:04:05.007
we've done those a bunch of times.

101
00:04:05.007 --> 00:04:08.108
Now the question is how do I size these

102
00:04:08.108 --> 00:04:09.915
implicitly created ones?

103
00:04:09.915 --> 00:04:12.928
Right, we can go ahead and size the values for

104
00:04:12.928 --> 00:04:15.463
the explicit ones no problem,

105
00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:18.079
but the implicit ones will look

106
00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.183
a little bit something like this.

107
00:04:19.183 --> 00:04:21.266
So we say grid auto rows,

108
00:04:22.547 --> 00:04:23.867
and the grid auto rows,

109
00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:25.743
will define how big the rows

110
00:04:25.743 --> 00:04:28.067
are for when they have been added,

111
00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:30.051
so if I were to then add,

112
00:04:30.051 --> 00:04:33.551
let's do something ridiculous like 500 PX.

113
00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:39.599
Now you'll see that any extra implicitly created rows

114
00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.590
are now gonna be 500 pixels high,

115
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.231
so if I were to dupe these over into seven and eight,

116
00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:48.299
you'll see that five, six, seven, eight,

117
00:04:48.299 --> 00:04:50.563
all of those implicitly created rows

118
00:04:50.563 --> 00:04:53.312
are going to be 500 pixels high.

119
00:04:53.312 --> 00:04:54.145
You might be thinking,

120
00:04:54.145 --> 00:04:56.076
okay, well could I do something like this?

121
00:04:56.076 --> 00:04:57.326
100 PX, 500 PX?

122
00:04:58.521 --> 00:05:00.854
And if we go and inspect it,

123
00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:04.372
you go on five and six,

124
00:05:04.372 --> 00:05:06.520
let's look at the rules here,

125
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.712
let's look at our container,

126
00:05:07.712 --> 00:05:09.307
you notice that it's actually crossed out,

127
00:05:09.307 --> 00:05:11.331
and that's actually currently an open issue

128
00:05:11.331 --> 00:05:14.227
at the time of recording in Firefox,

129
00:05:14.227 --> 00:05:17.227
is that in Firefox you are not able

130
00:05:17.227 --> 00:05:19.977
to define what multiple implicit,

131
00:05:21.171 --> 00:05:23.751
the size of multiple implicit rows,

132
00:05:23.751 --> 00:05:27.897
and if we were to open that up in Chrome,

133
00:05:27.897 --> 00:05:30.159
you'll see that it actually does work.

134
00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:31.763
So you should be able to do it,

135
00:05:31.763 --> 00:05:33.577
it should be fixed fairly soon,

136
00:05:33.577 --> 00:05:35.595
but at the time of recording you are only able

137
00:05:35.595 --> 00:05:39.315
to pass one value for the implicit rows.

138
00:05:39.315 --> 00:05:42.398
Okay, we also have grid auto columns.

139
00:05:45.066 --> 00:05:47.123
And let's say that would be 100 PX,

140
00:05:47.123 --> 00:05:48.059
and give that a save,

141
00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:50.519
now that didn't do anything,

142
00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:52.919
and that's like how do you get extra columns?

143
00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.522
So by default,

144
00:05:54.522 --> 00:05:56.671
what will happen is you define your columns,

145
00:05:56.671 --> 00:05:58.615
and then any extra elements

146
00:05:58.615 --> 00:06:01.459
will automatically be turned into rows,

147
00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:04.207
but that's where the next video comes in,

148
00:06:04.207 --> 00:06:06.306
we are gonna be talking about something

149
00:06:06.306 --> 00:06:08.259
called grid auto flow,

150
00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:11.961
and that is instead of automatically giving us rows,

151
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:14.543
we are gonna automatically give us more columns,

152
00:06:14.543 --> 00:06:15.684
so I'll see you in the next video.

153
