00:00:00.322 --> 00:00:03.287
(rock intro)

2
00:00:03.287 --> 00:00:04.714
<v Wes>Alright let's talk about how to</v>

3
00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:07.677
actually get the items to go where we want.

4
00:00:07.677 --> 00:00:10.533
So let's open up ten placing, placing start,

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.841
we've got the same grid that we were working with before

6
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:14.393
including our little poop.

7
00:00:14.393 --> 00:00:15.606
He's so cute.

8
00:00:15.606 --> 00:00:19.658
And uh next up we want to select an item.

9
00:00:19.658 --> 00:00:23.825
So let's select, let's give this guy a class of poop

10
00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:27.582
and let's grab on to the poop.

11
00:00:30.608 --> 00:00:32.473
And before what we did was we said

12
00:00:32.473 --> 00:00:37.133
grid, column, span 2, and that would just span it two.

13
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:41.422
Let's give it a background of bad ass, B A D A55.

14
00:00:41.422 --> 00:00:45.677
Good, well what grid column is actually shorthand for is

15
00:00:45.677 --> 00:00:48.232
actually two values and I can show you that.

16
00:00:48.232 --> 00:00:52.142
Let's uh inspect it here and open up your rules tab

17
00:00:52.142 --> 00:00:54.022
and you see a grid column is here.

18
00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:57.223
One neat thing about um dev tools is if you open it up

19
00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:00.323
you'll see that anytime you have a shorthand property

20
00:01:00.323 --> 00:01:02.910
you can open it up to see what the longhand property

21
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.533
actually are, like background has a ton of 'em.

22
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.922
Um you see it's grid column start span 2

23
00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:11.876
and then grid column end auto.

24
00:01:11.876 --> 00:01:13.958
So what we're actually doing is we're actually

25
00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.183
telling it to um be

26
00:01:16.183 --> 00:01:19.518
just start where you normally would but go twice the size.

27
00:01:19.518 --> 00:01:21.807
So let's actually get rid of grid column

28
00:01:21.807 --> 00:01:24.657
and just explicitly define them as we want

29
00:01:24.657 --> 00:01:26.618
and how we can do that now is if we say

30
00:01:26.618 --> 00:01:30.858
grid column start and let's say we want it to

31
00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:32.633
start at now where do we start?

32
00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:34.380
Well, we can start at track values.

33
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.911
If we head over to our layout tab, turn it on.

34
00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:38.965
You see all of these track numbers here?

35
00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:42.040
So if I wanted the poop to start at two,

36
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.933
again this is the uh the number two track that we have

37
00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:48.766
we would just say two, give that a save

38
00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:51.488
and what that's going to do is it's going to

39
00:01:51.488 --> 00:01:55.226
lay all of the ones out before it, which is eight,

40
00:01:55.226 --> 00:01:58.157
and then it's going to start the poop at two

41
00:01:58.157 --> 00:02:01.219
and then similarly we can say grid column end

42
00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.668
and if we wanted to end it at, let's do

43
00:02:04.668 --> 00:02:05.501
five

44
00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:10.694
it's going to span it all the way across.

45
00:02:10.694 --> 00:02:13.277
So instead of us telling it to span three,

46
00:02:13.277 --> 00:02:14.759
we can just tell it the start

47
00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.208
and the stop values that we want.

48
00:02:17.208 --> 00:02:19.518
So similarly, if we wanted to do that in one go

49
00:02:19.518 --> 00:02:22.753
we would just say grid, column, and we would say two

50
00:02:22.753 --> 00:02:25.782
and then the shorthand is forward slash five

51
00:02:25.782 --> 00:02:27.747
and get rid of these two here and that's

52
00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:29.249
the exact same value.

53
00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:33.397
So start and stop um similarly we could also say

54
00:02:33.397 --> 00:02:37.724
we want it to span two but we want it to end at five

55
00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:40.615
and that'll give us the exact same value

56
00:02:40.615 --> 00:02:42.444
except now that it's two

57
00:02:42.444 --> 00:02:45.296
or what you could do is you could tell it to uh

58
00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:47.379
start at one and span two

59
00:02:50.474 --> 00:02:52.786
and in that case it's going to start at one and span two.

60
00:02:52.786 --> 00:02:55.890
So you see how we can either just tell it where to start

61
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.152
and where to stop or we can tell it, either where to start

62
00:02:59.152 --> 00:03:02.069
or where to stop and then tell it how big

63
00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.759
we actually wish it to be.

64
00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:05.748
It's actually really really flexible in that case

65
00:03:05.748 --> 00:03:07.149
and I really like that.

66
00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:09.080
Um, it's pretty nifty.

67
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.038
Uh another thing we can also do is

68
00:03:11.038 --> 00:03:14.465
you can tell it to always start at the start which is one

69
00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:17.256
and you can tell it to end at the last track.

70
00:03:17.256 --> 00:03:20.691
So if you do not know how many, uh, tracks you will have

71
00:03:20.691 --> 00:03:23.036
you just say negative one and that will

72
00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.268
that will span it across.

73
00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:27.686
So I often will use this as a

74
00:03:27.686 --> 00:03:30.152
sort of like a width 100%,

75
00:03:30.152 --> 00:03:34.036
anytime you want to span um an item across the entire

76
00:03:34.036 --> 00:03:35.978
grid, its a one negative one.

77
00:03:35.978 --> 00:03:39.811
If I did negative two it'll start you off two,

78
00:03:41.188 --> 00:03:44.034
or sorry, one from the actual end and you can

79
00:03:44.034 --> 00:03:45.863
keep going as far as you want.

80
00:03:45.863 --> 00:03:48.748
You can say negative four but at that point uh,

81
00:03:48.748 --> 00:03:50.839
there's not a whole lot you can do.

82
00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:54.275
We still can mix and match these with the rows as well.

83
00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:58.723
So we say grid row uh if we want to start at three

84
00:03:58.723 --> 00:04:00.587
that's where it it, let's keep it there

85
00:04:00.587 --> 00:04:03.098
and then I want to span three.

86
00:04:03.098 --> 00:04:06.449
That will start it here and span three as we want

87
00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.122
and it will sort of fit it in as we want.

88
00:04:09.122 --> 00:04:11.593
You could also tell it to go to seven,

89
00:04:11.593 --> 00:04:14.527
so start` at three, go to seven.

90
00:04:14.527 --> 00:04:18.052
Eight you see that it gets as big as we want.

91
00:04:18.052 --> 00:04:20.102
What if we wanted it to span from the top,

92
00:04:20.102 --> 00:04:23.063
which is grid row one, good starts at the top,

93
00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:24.855
all the way to the end of the grid,

94
00:04:24.855 --> 00:04:26.739
you think negative one right?

95
00:04:26.739 --> 00:04:29.291
Give it a shot, whaaat?

96
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:32.502
Why didn't that work similarly how it did to this?

97
00:04:32.502 --> 00:04:34.385
Where I would say one negative one,

98
00:04:34.385 --> 00:04:36.659
it would span all the way across

99
00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:39.296
but if I do one negative one for rows,

100
00:04:39.296 --> 00:04:40.877
it's only taking up one row

101
00:04:40.877 --> 00:04:43.118
and it seems to be uh putting it before

102
00:04:43.118 --> 00:04:45.365
any of the other items that are in there

103
00:04:45.365 --> 00:04:47.406
and I believe that is because we did not

104
00:04:47.406 --> 00:04:49.079
explicitly define any rows.

105
00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:52.592
So grid template rows and if we give that a save,

106
00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:55.150
you'll see ooh interesting here what's happening

107
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.460
is that I'm actually taking up the entire grid here

108
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.934
so if you ever want to take up an entire grid,

109
00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:04.414
this is what you do, one negative one one negative one

110
00:05:04.414 --> 00:05:07.921
and that takes up the, let's give these black,

111
00:05:07.921 --> 00:05:09.860
and do our little bit of zooming.

112
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.827
This is the entire explicit grid meaning this it the grid

113
00:05:13.827 --> 00:05:16.609
that we have created and then what's happening with the

114
00:05:16.609 --> 00:05:19.570
rest of these is that there was nowhere for

115
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.689
these rest of the elements to go so they get tossed

116
00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:26.316
into the implicit grid which is um where the

117
00:05:26.316 --> 00:05:28.909
implicit rows have then been created.

118
00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.145
So let me not do both of those.

119
00:05:31.145 --> 00:05:34.812
So let me just bring column back to span two

120
00:05:34.812 --> 00:05:37.873
and then here it will, negative one,

121
00:05:37.873 --> 00:05:41.768
will only ever go to the bottom of the explicit grid

122
00:05:41.768 --> 00:05:45.913
not the bottom of the implicit grid that we have there.

123
00:05:45.913 --> 00:05:47.559
So hopefully we have that, we're gonna do

124
00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:49.282
a bunch of exercises next which will

125
00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:51.798
get you comfortable with placing and spanning

126
00:05:51.798 --> 00:05:53.804
and sizing all of our elements.

127
00:05:53.804 --> 00:05:56.637
