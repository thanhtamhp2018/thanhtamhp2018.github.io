00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.886
<v ->Alright, real quick one is the ability</v>

2
00:00:05.886 --> 00:00:07.685
to re-order your items,

3
00:00:07.685 --> 00:00:09.485
so if there was not enough ways

4
00:00:09.485 --> 00:00:13.224
to move where your items go in CSS grid,

5
00:00:13.224 --> 00:00:15.947
there's also an order property which will allow us

6
00:00:15.947 --> 00:00:17.892
to show up where we want them.

7
00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:20.464
So, let's open up re-order grid, and order start,

8
00:00:20.464 --> 00:00:22.214
and we got an example coming up

9
00:00:22.214 --> 00:00:24.121
where we're gonna have a logo and a navigation

10
00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:26.046
and we want to re-order it at a media query,

11
00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:28.276
but let's do a quick little example

12
00:00:28.276 --> 00:00:29.659
of what this would look like.

13
00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.803
So, here I'm going to make a quick little grid,

14
00:00:33.803 --> 00:00:37.970
so, say, grid, template, columns, and we'll repeat.

15
00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.809
Let's do a ten grid one, one F-R.

16
00:00:45.137 --> 00:00:47.930
Good, and then, I want the content

17
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.211
to be grid column one, negative one

18
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:53.343
because I want it to go all the way across.

19
00:00:53.343 --> 00:00:55.344
Good, and then the logo,

20
00:00:55.344 --> 00:00:59.427
I want it to span two, so grid column to span two

21
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.067
and the nav, I want to grid column, span eight.

22
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.910
Good, I have my logo and I have my nav,

23
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.583
but what if I wanted to put the nav before the logo

24
00:01:13.583 --> 00:01:15.433
or any other order that I would want.

25
00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:17.322
And, that sometimes would happen at a media query

26
00:01:17.322 --> 00:01:19.060
as soon as you get at a smaller point

27
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.604
and this is an example we're gonna have,

28
00:01:20.604 --> 00:01:23.521
I wanna put the nav above the logo.

29
00:01:24.562 --> 00:01:25.656
So, how would that work?

30
00:01:25.656 --> 00:01:27.954
Well, you can give your items an order property.

31
00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:32.121
So, if I go to my logo and give it an order of one,

32
00:01:33.462 --> 00:01:35.084
that actually puts it at the end,

33
00:01:35.084 --> 00:01:36.570
and why does that happen?

34
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.460
Because the default order of everything is zero

35
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.307
and then if you give something a one

36
00:01:41.307 --> 00:01:42.959
it actually moves it to the end,

37
00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:44.727
so you need to put an order property

38
00:01:44.727 --> 00:01:46.528
on the rest of our items here.

39
00:01:46.528 --> 00:01:48.160
So, logo would be two,

40
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.993
nav order will be one,

41
00:01:51.547 --> 00:01:56.226
and then, the content order is going to be three.

42
00:01:56.226 --> 00:01:58.463
And, there we go, we have it all.

43
00:01:58.463 --> 00:02:00.527
What I should mention before we get into any of this

44
00:02:00.527 --> 00:02:02.284
because obviously it's very simple in how it works

45
00:02:02.284 --> 00:02:05.631
is that it will goof up your select

46
00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:07.640
as well as your accessibility.

47
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.853
So, even though the source order,

48
00:02:09.853 --> 00:02:11.576
logo, nav, content,

49
00:02:11.576 --> 00:02:13.637
and then it goes nav, logo, content,

50
00:02:13.637 --> 00:02:15.738
so, they are coming in different orders,

51
00:02:15.738 --> 00:02:18.238
it will both goof up the order

52
00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:22.502
at which your screen reader will read it back to you.

53
00:02:22.502 --> 00:02:26.176
So, don't do this for things that have,

54
00:02:26.176 --> 00:02:28.846
in this case, the nav and the logo, it doesn't matter

55
00:02:28.846 --> 00:02:30.294
which order they come into a screen reader,

56
00:02:30.294 --> 00:02:34.226
but for, let's say you had some content,

57
00:02:34.226 --> 00:02:36.764
don't re-arrange like a paragraph tag

58
00:02:36.764 --> 00:02:39.717
into a different order just with CSS

59
00:02:39.717 --> 00:02:43.272
because it's not gonna get read back to everyone that way.

60
00:02:43.272 --> 00:02:46.884
So, and also, if I were try to select this text,

61
00:02:46.884 --> 00:02:48.359
say select nav

62
00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.025
and then as soon as I get the logo, it unselects it.

63
00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:53.013
But, if I were to select it like backwards,

64
00:02:53.013 --> 00:02:54.198
it still doesn't work.

65
00:02:54.198 --> 00:02:57.841
So, those are two gotchas with the order property.

66
00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:00.817
Make sure that you know how that works.

67
00:03:00.817 --> 00:03:04.926
So, that's my very simple example as to how order will work,

68
00:03:04.926 --> 00:03:06.901
but we'll go into some more advanced examples

69
00:03:06.901 --> 00:03:11.068
or very simple examples as we get into real world.
