<v Instructor>Next two videos</v>

2
00:00:04.958 --> 00:00:06.737
we're going to learn about auto fit, auto fill,

3
00:00:06.737 --> 00:00:08.161
and min max, and I'd say after,

4
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:11.079
I don't know, six months, a year of using CSS grid,

5
00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:13.777
along with grid template columns,

6
00:00:13.777 --> 00:00:15.937
the auto fit, auto fill and min max

7
00:00:15.937 --> 00:00:19.137
are probably my most used pieces of grid.

8
00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:22.540
So get ready, it's gonna be exciting!

9
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.657
So open up 12 auto fit and auto fill,

10
00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.180
we're first gonna learn about what they are,

11
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.721
and what the differences are,

12
00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:30.337
and then we're going to look at min max

13
00:00:30.337 --> 00:00:32.097
where you're gonna, it will probably click

14
00:00:32.097 --> 00:00:33.697
and go, "oh, that's super handy."

15
00:00:33.697 --> 00:00:35.441
So, I've got a whole bunch of items here,

16
00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:38.033
and now I've got the word "item" in it,

17
00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:39.857
because I want these to be a little bit bigger,

18
00:00:39.857 --> 00:00:42.220
and actually have some content inside of them,

19
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.039
and we'll go and start to make some columns,

20
00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.700
so say grid template columns,

21
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.459
and we're going to repeat.

22
00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:53.399
And instead of saying repeat something like,

23
00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.920
I don't know, five at 100 px,

24
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.039
that will just give us five,

25
00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.140
and you don't really know how many will fit,

26
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.417
because the content of these items

27
00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:03.998
could be bigger, could be smaller,

28
00:01:03.998 --> 00:01:06.620
depends on what is actually inside of them,

29
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.177
and it's likely not just numbers

30
00:01:08.177 --> 00:01:09.900
like we've been doing so far.

31
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.799
So we have these key words called auto fill and auto fit,

32
00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.313
and let's see what they do.

33
00:01:15.313 --> 00:01:17.900
So auto fill, let's do that first,

34
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.650
and let's try 150 px,

35
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:23.820
right here we have to sort of guess

36
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.639
how big one will be,

37
00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:27.479
but in the next video we're going to show

38
00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.260
how we can automatically size them.

39
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.878
So what does auto fill do?

40
00:01:30.878 --> 00:01:33.921
So actually you don't tell it how many columns you want,

41
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:36.380
you just say, I don't know, figure it out,

42
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.656
see how much content is in each one,

43
00:01:38.656 --> 00:01:42.860
and then figure out how many you could possibly fit in that.

44
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.094
So I've got my dev tools open,

45
00:01:44.094 --> 00:01:46.935
I've got the grid Dev Tools turned onto my container here.

46
00:01:46.935 --> 00:01:49.457
Now when I resize this, you'll see that

47
00:01:49.457 --> 00:01:52.337
what's happening is as I resize

48
00:01:52.337 --> 00:01:53.670
the actual items

49
00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.220
are just jumping onto the next line,

50
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.679
and as there is just enough space

51
00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.540
to actually put another one,

52
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.041
it's gonna reflow the actual value there

53
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:07.255
and break onto the next line.

54
00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:08.940
So that's great.

55
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.199
What is auto fit?

56
00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.679
As an alternative to that?

57
00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:16.380
That doesn't seem to do anything different,

58
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.380
so what's the auto fill?

59
00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.377
It doesn't do anything,

60
00:02:21.377 --> 00:02:23.639
it looks like they're actually doing the exact same thing.

61
00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:26.337
So let me actually show you what the difference is.

62
00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:28.481
The difference is that when you don't have enough items

63
00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:31.452
to fill up the entire width or the height of a grid.

64
00:02:31.452 --> 00:02:33.420
So let's bring this down to four items,

65
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.097
delete everything up until four,

66
00:02:36.097 --> 00:02:37.857
and then give that a save.

67
00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:39.420
Now what we see here

68
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.220
is that when we have auto fill on,

69
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.060
it will sort of like chop up the grid

70
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.140
into as many spaces as it can,

71
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.359
so it looks like that here,

72
00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.180
we can fit four five six spots,

73
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.417
and then you see it ends the explicit grid,

74
00:02:56.417 --> 00:02:59.041
this is the edge of the explicit grid here,

75
00:02:59.041 --> 00:03:01.073
and then there's just a little bit of extra

76
00:03:01.073 --> 00:03:03.457
that is wasted space, because we can't fit it.

77
00:03:03.457 --> 00:03:05.319
But as we were to make it bigger,

78
00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.097
it's gonna pop on an extra one,

79
00:03:08.097 --> 00:03:10.097
you see go back, on and off, on and off,

80
00:03:10.097 --> 00:03:12.897
just as we have space for that one.

81
00:03:12.897 --> 00:03:15.681
The difference with auto fill and auto fit,

82
00:03:15.681 --> 00:03:17.856
watch how we have it now,

83
00:03:17.856 --> 00:03:20.560
give it a save, you'll notice that it actually ends

84
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.700
the grid right here.

85
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.235
It actually also, it still shows us that we have

86
00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:27.038
seven tracks, but they seem to all be piled

87
00:03:27.038 --> 00:03:28.679
on top of each other.

88
00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:30.161
I'm not sure if that's actually

89
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:31.819
how it's supposed to work,

90
00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.319
or if that's just a bug in laying out all the items there,

91
00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.692
but you see that the grid actually stops right here,

92
00:03:39.692 --> 00:03:42.174
and there's nothing done to the right.

93
00:03:42.174 --> 00:03:43.857
Now why would that be helpful?

94
00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:45.697
Well, if we bring it back to auto fill,

95
00:03:45.697 --> 00:03:47.841
let's say I wanted to put this item here,

96
00:03:47.841 --> 00:03:49.841
and this is something I do quite often,

97
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:52.657
where maybe you've got a bunch of buttons here

98
00:03:52.657 --> 00:03:54.540
and then you want to like put something on

99
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.940
the very right side, what we could do,

100
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.697
is we select item4, and we just say, grid column,

101
00:04:01.697 --> 00:04:05.041
auto, or start it wherever it normally would start,

102
00:04:05.041 --> 00:04:07.079
and we're going to end it at the end,

103
00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.199
which is negative one.

104
00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.857
Alternatively we could just say

105
00:04:09.857 --> 00:04:11.601
grid column end,

106
00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:13.937
and just give it an ending value,

107
00:04:13.937 --> 00:04:15.697
and you see what happens is that

108
00:04:15.697 --> 00:04:17.959
it tacks it onto the end of wherever the grid will end

109
00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.380
rather than putting it right where it would normally flow

110
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.300
at the four line.

111
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.611
Now if we were to change that from fill to fit,

112
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:31.598
there's no way to tack it onto the end, because,

113
00:04:31.598 --> 00:04:35.181
there is no extra columns being added here,

114
00:04:36.261 --> 00:04:38.901
you would simply just end it right here.

115
00:04:38.901 --> 00:04:40.940
So how do you tell the difference between one?

116
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.263
Well, you try one,

117
00:04:42.263 --> 00:04:43.900
and if it's not what you want,

118
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.900
it's probably the other one. (laughs)

119
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.740
That's the best that I can think about

120
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.143
remembering it.

121
00:04:49.143 --> 00:04:50.759
Now, that's not all that useful,

122
00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.100
but in the next video, we're going to be looking at

123
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.641
something called min max

124
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:56.423
where auto fit and auto fill

125
00:04:56.423 --> 00:04:58.459
do something a little bit different.

126
00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:00.959
So I'll see you in that video.
