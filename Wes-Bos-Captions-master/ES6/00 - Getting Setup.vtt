00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
 Instructor: I hope 

2
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.620
you're super excited to learn 

3
00:00:03.695 --> 00:00:04.880
ES6. I just wanted to have a 

4
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.090
quick video, in order to get you 

5
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.320
set up for this. First of all, 

6
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.820
you need a browser that can 

7
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.950
support ES6. Right now, that's 

8
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.580
all of the latest versions of a 

9
00:00:12.655 --> 00:00:14.130
browser. I'm going to be using 

10
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.940
Chrome in this one, but grab the 

11
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.660
latest Internet Explorer Edge, 

12
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.950
or Firefox, or latest Safari, 

13
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.600
and you'd be good to go. Once 

14
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.140
you are signed in, go ahead and 

15
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.480
you can stream the course by 

16
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.480
clicking it here. You can go 

17
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.430
ahead and download all of the 

18
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.340
videos if you prefer to watch 

19
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.870
them offline. Then, you also 

20
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.090
want to make sure that you grab 

21
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.190
the starter files. Now, starter 

22
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.740
files are hosted up on GitHub 

23
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.850
here. It's just a whole bunch of 

24
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.670
different HTML and JavaScript 

25
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.490
files that we're going to be 

26
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.710
using throughout the course. 

27
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.630
I recommend that you code all of 

28
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.260
this stuff yourself, sort of 

29
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.580
from scratch. I think it's going 

30
00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:50.400
to set in the best. But if you 

31
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.620
prefer to just watch them and 

32
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.880
then code them after, you can do 

33
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:54.880
that, or if you will just need 

34
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.260
to reference some of the code, 

35
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.120
it's also available inside of 

36
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.380
here. There is a file called 

37
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.980
data.js. If you ever need just 

38
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.910
an array of things, or a couple 

39
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.330
objects, or just some data to 

40
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.350
actually work with, then I 

41
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.100
recommend grabbing it from here. 

42
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.310
I also use this data throughout 

43
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.430
the entire series. That's 

44
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.090
pretty much it, so enjoy the 

45
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.470
course. Make sure you jump into 

46
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.410
the Slack channel and chat with 

47
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.610
everyone else who's taking it. 

48
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.090
Enjoy.
