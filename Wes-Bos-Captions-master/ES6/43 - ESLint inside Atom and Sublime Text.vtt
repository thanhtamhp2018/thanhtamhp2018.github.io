00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.340
 Instructor: Ideally 

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.220
you have ESLint set up right in 

3
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.600
your editor, so as you write 

4
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:07.980
code you can just have it in 

5
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.700
real time telling you what your 

6
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.190
errors and what your warnings 

7
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.580
are. Now I'm going to show 

8
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.950
how to use it in Sublime Text 

9
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.200
and Atom, since those are 

10
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.490
probably the two most popular 

11
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.040
ones used with JavaScript 

12
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.510
developers. However, every 

13
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.270
editor worth its salt has some 

14
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.960
sort of ESLint and linting 

15
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.580
integration so you can feel free 

16
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.140
to check that out with your 

17
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.880
specific editor. If you 

18
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.020
don't use Atom or you don't use 

19
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.370
Sublime, feel free to skip these 

20
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.430
ones or if you use Atom skip the 

21
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.660
Sublime one, and I'll show you 

22
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.100
how to use exactly in Atom 

23
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.970
throughout this video. With 

24
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.920
Sublime Text we need to use 

25
00:00:41.995 --> 00:00:43.120
something called SublimeLinter. 

26
00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:44.820
SublimeLinter is sort of like a 

27
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.310
framework for all linting 

28
00:00:46.385 --> 00:00:47.910
because there's PHPLint and 

29
00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:48.680
CSSLint and SASSLint and there's 

30
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.550
all different kinds of linting 

31
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.590
that you can do for different 

32
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.340
languages. Rather than 

33
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.980
installing an ESLint plugin 

34
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.730
directly, we install a linting 

35
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.070
framework, and then we will 

36
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.480
install plugin for that linting 

37
00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:03.050
framework. What you need to 

38
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.410
do is, first of all, have 

39
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.160
package control installed. I 

40
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.190
assume you know how to do that, 

41
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.770
if not, you can take a look on 

42
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.620
how to do it or watch my Sublime 

43
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.360
Text video series. I'm going 

44
00:01:14.435 --> 00:01:16.780
to type install package and from 

45
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.160
that you type SublimeLinter. 

46
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:31.050
 Instructor: I don't 

47
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.050
see it showing up in here 

48
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.140
because I already have it 

49
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.070
installed. If you do not see it, 

50
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.780
that probably means you already 

51
00:01:36.855 --> 00:01:37.190
have it installed as well. 

52
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.920
After you've installed that one, 

53
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.120
go ahead and type install 

54
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.260
package again and you want the 

55
00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:44.760
SublimeLinter and you just 

56
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.720
search for ESLint. Again, I 

57
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.600
don't see it as well, but it's 

58
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.050
going to say SublimeLinter-

59
00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:52.750
contrib-eslint, and you go 

60
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.410
ahead and install that one. 

61
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.750
If you want to know if you have 

62
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.390
them both installed you can just 

63
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.090
type list packages and you 

64
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.640
should look for lint, you see 

65
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.940
that I have SublimeLinter and 

66
00:02:04.015 --> 00:02:05.140
SublimeLinter-contrib-eslint. 

67
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.700
Those two are the ones that I 

68
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.070
use to lint my JavaScript and 

69
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.900
you need to make sure that you 

70
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.300
have them installed. The 

71
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.880
third thing you need to do, and 

72
00:02:14.955 --> 00:02:15.690
this is very, very important, is 

73
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.520
that you have to have ESLint 

74
00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:20.500
globally installed. These 

75
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.000
plugins don't come with ESLint. 

76
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.110
They use your system's ESLint. 

77
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.500
Again, if you've been doing this 

78
00:02:25.575 --> 00:02:26.650
tutorial with me you already 

79
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.210
have it installed, but double 

80
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.410
check by saying eslint -- 

81
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.240
version and see that you have 

82
00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:34.770
ESLint actually installed. In my 

83
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.740
experience, you have to give 

84
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.670
Sublime Text a full shutdown, so 

85
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.090
do a Sublime Text quit. Then 

86
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.440
open up Sublime Text again to 

87
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.080
get it to run. Then what you 

88
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.160
need to do is turn it on so that 

89
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.050
it lints as to your preference. 

90
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.700
I like to have my linting every 

91
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.410
time I hit save, it's going to 

92
00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:52.480
lint it. Sometimes you can also 

93
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.670
just lint it on demand, or 

94
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.460
people have it linting every 

95
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.500
single time that the type a 

96
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.890
character. I find that when 

97
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.070
you are typing and you're not 

98
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.580
done writing your code, it will 

99
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.820
give you errors before you're 

100
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.600
done. Then on the other end, you 

101
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.270
just forget to lint, so I like 

102
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.810
to do it on save. The way that 

103
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.680
you do that is open up your 

104
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.340
command palette, Command shift P 

105
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.780
or control shift P on Windows 

106
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:14.750
and just type SublimeLinter. 

107
00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:17.660
You can see all of the possible 

108
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.510
options. What we want to do is 

109
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.680
Choose Lint Mode, and here we 

110
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.250
have "background," lint whenever 

111
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.520
text is modified, that's as you 

112
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.640
type. "Load or save," only do it 

113
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.520
when the file is loaded or saved. 

114
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.990
That's what I have it. "Only 

115
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.930
do it on save." I do it on load, 

116
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.180
because when you open a new file 

117
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.900
I also want to lint it. Then 

118
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.950
finally, "manually lint only 

119
00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:40.850
when requested." I could do it 

120
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.740
manually here, and then I could 

121
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.960
just write all the code not 

122
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.150
knowing there's any errors, and 

123
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.540
then I could just say "Lint this 

124
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.490
view," and it's going to lint it. 

125
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.310
You'll start seeing that you 

126
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.250
have dots show up in the sidebar 

127
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.390
here. That means that there's 

128
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.860
errors, in my side bar, and then 

129
00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.930
it will actually underline the 

130
00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:01.510
actual characters that are 

131
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.670
giving me grief. Sublime Text 

132
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.140
shows them in the status bar at 

133
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.670
the very bottom here. It's kind 

134
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.670
of small and it's a little bit 

135
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.800
out of the way, so you have to 

136
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.590
look back at it. What I like to 

137
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.600
do is just click on it and then 

138
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.620
read error, tweets is never 

139
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.460
reassigned. Use const. Prefer 

140
00:04:18.535 --> 00:04:21.780
const. That's the error that I 

141
00:04:21.855 --> 00:04:22.500
have. I would change this 

142
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.950
one to const, give it a save, 

143
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.120
and now I see another error. Now 

144
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.430
I don't see any errors, actually, 

145
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.430
because I have to "Lint this 

146
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.580
view." I don't want to do that, 

147
00:04:33.655 --> 00:04:34.180
so I'm going to say Choose 

148
00:04:34.255 --> 00:04:34.980
Linting Mode and I'm going to 

149
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.240
say "load or save." Now when 

150
00:04:38.315 --> 00:04:40.010
I give it a save, immediately it 

151
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.620
shows up and I can just see here, 

152
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.660
a space is required after curly. 

153
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.520
I got a bit of a space issue 

154
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.500
here. A save, now I've still got 

155
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.630
something popping up here. What 

156
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.860
is it telling me? Space is 

157
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.130
required after the curly. Save, 

158
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.900
and I just go through these one 

159
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.810
by one, without having to run it 

160
00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.330
from the command line. This does 

161
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.020
it in every single JS file. 

162
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.560
That's what Sublime is. It's 

163
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.480
pretty simple to get set up. 

164
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.200
Sometimes people have trouble 

165
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.620
getting it up and running, and 

166
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.720
it's really important that you 

167
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.230
do those three things. Make sure 

168
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.360
you have ESLink globally 

169
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.670
installed, make sure you have 

170
00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.380
SublimeLinter installed first, 

171
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.400
and then install the contrib 

172
00:05:16.475 --> 00:05:18.000
eslint package for SublimeLinter. 

173
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.680
If you get all those three lined 

174
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.460
up perfectly, you should be in 

175
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.110
really good shape having linting 

176
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.500
working. You don't have to do it 

177
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.870
via the command line any longer. 

178
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.700
Atom works very much the same 

179
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.120
way, except they don't use the 

180
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.010
Sublime contrib eslint package, 

181
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.610
it uses its own package. Here 

182
00:05:35.685 --> 00:05:37.210
I've got it up and I'm running 

183
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.000
using the same cobalt2 color 

184
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.320
scheme here. But one cool thing 

185
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.540
about Atom is that, first of all, 

186
00:05:43.615 --> 00:05:44.280
it will give you the errors 

187
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.620
nicely down here. It's a little 

188
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.300
bit nicer than Sublime Text. 

189
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.550
Also, when you click on one of 

190
00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:51.310
them it will tell you unexpected 

191
00:05:51.385 --> 00:05:53.610
var. It will give you the actual 

192
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.850
name of it, you can click on it, 

193
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.600
it will bring you to the 

194
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.610
documentation. The 

195
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.960
implementation in Atom is 

196
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.780
actually much better if you're 

197
00:06:01.855 --> 00:06:04.200
using Atom. How do we get 

198
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.670
this installed? First of all you 

199
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.570
need to go to your settings and 

200
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.590
install two packages. Those two 

201
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.540
packages are linter, which is 

202
00:06:11.615 --> 00:06:13.540
like the linting framework, just 

203
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.500
like we did with Sublime Text, 

204
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:15.940
and then the second thing you 

205
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.340
want is linter-eslint. I've 

206
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.600
already installed those, but you 

207
00:06:19.675 --> 00:06:21.560
would just type here for linter. 

208
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.870
You'll go ahead install that, 

209
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.220
and then the other one is linter-

210
00:06:25.295 --> 00:06:26.450
eslint, which you would install 

211
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.330
that. Once you have those 

212
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.160
installed, you simply go ahead 

213
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.930
and start writing your .JS code 

214
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.860
and you are up and running. No 

215
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.310
further configuration needed.
