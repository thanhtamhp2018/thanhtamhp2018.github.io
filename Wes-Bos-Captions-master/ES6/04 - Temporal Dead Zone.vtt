2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.470
Let's talk real quick about the 

3
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.170
temporal dead zone. This is a 

4
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.300
bit of a boring topic, so I'm 

5
00:00:07.375 --> 00:00:07.770
going to try and make it really 

6
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.440
fun for you. This is something 

7
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.210
that you probably won't come 

8
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.440
across too often, but it's 

9
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.410
helpful to know in case someone 

10
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.130
ever slings it out in an 

11
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.530
interview. You'd be able to talk 

12
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.160
them about it. First of all, I 

13
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.590
call it the temporal dad zone, 

14
00:00:18.665 --> 00:00:20.180
which is kind of fun. Let's 

15
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.070
make a var variable called pizza 

16
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.790
and set it to deep dish, and 

17
00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:26.590
we'll put a pizza emoji in there. 

18
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.980
What happens when you try and 

19
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.030
console log pizza after it's 

20
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.590
been created. You'll see that we 

21
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.980
actually get to see deep dish, 

22
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.640
right? No big issue there. What 

23
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.580
if I try to console log it 

24
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.180
before? Are we going to get a) 

25
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.500
Undefined, b) Pizza is not yet 

26
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.260
defined error, or c) Are we 

27
00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:45.170
actually going to see the word 

28
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.580
deep dish with the pizza emoji? 

29
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.810
We get a) Undefined. Undefined, 

30
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.970
why? Because with var variables, 

31
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.510
you can actually access them as 

32
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.260
they are defined. Before they 

33
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.910
are defined, you cannot access 

34
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.050
the actual value of them, but 

35
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.090
you can access the fact that the 

36
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.960
variable has been created before. 

37
00:01:02.035 --> 00:01:04.440
If I change that to const or let, 

38
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.860
you'll now see that pizza is not 

39
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.640
defined at all. That's an actual 

40
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.600
error, and that will break your 

41
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.250
code. That is called the 

42
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.820
temporal dead zone, where you 

43
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.540
cannot access a variable before 

44
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.260
it is defined. They mean that 

45
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.800
this is the temporal dead zone 

46
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.850
right here, because you cannot 

47
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.930
access it before it has been 

48
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.440
created. That's pretty much it. 

49
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.580
That's all you need to know. Put 

50
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.500
that in your back pocket, 

51
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.410
because you'll need it someday.
