♪ [music] ♪

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Last thing I want to talk about is
something I like to call "templating

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
helpers," where sometimes you need data
available in every single request.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if you look at our website here, you'll
see the tab says "undefined - Now That's

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Delicious!" So if we look at our
layout.pug, you'll notice that it's asking

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
us to pass it a title variable, and we
haven't. So that's an easy fix.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We can go back to our hello, and pass it a
title, and say, like...

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.760 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"I love food," and then when I refresh,
you'll see that "I love food" is now in

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the title. Why? Because we passed the
locals a title variable,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.790 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then we used it.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, what about the site name, "Now That's
Delicious!"? You notice that I'm not

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
passing it on every single request,
because it's...that would be too

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
cumbersome to pass that to every single
render. I'd rather just have every single

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
request have that data available. And
that's where I like to make a file called

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"helpers.js," and if you open up your
application, right in the main folder,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you're gonna see helpers.js. And I just
called it "helpers," you might be able to

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
name it something a little bit better.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:30.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But essentially what helpers.js does is, I
put any helper libraries or any data that

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I need in every single template, I put it
in my helpers.js file.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if you scroll to the bottom, you'll see
exports.siteName, so the site name

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
property, is "Now That's Delicious!" and
that's what getting piped into there.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if I were to change that to "hi That's
Delicious!" and hit refresh...and now,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
see, "hi That's Delicious!"
You get the point, right?

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Same with the menu here. I've opted to not
just hard code every single menu,

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I've opted to be able to put the "stores,"
"tags," "top," "add," and "map," I put

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
those in an array so if I were to ever
change them, or you were to build some

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sort of back-end interface for managing
the menu, I could take a couple of them

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
out, refresh the page, and they will
automatically be gone. So if you look at

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:28.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
layout.pug, you will see here: "each item
in h.menu." So what "each" will do is,

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it will loop over every single item in an
array, and then you can simply say

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"item.slug," "item.icon," "item.title,"
and that data is all coming from

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
item.slug, title, and icon, that we have
being pulled in there.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm doing a little bit more stuff where
I'm adding a class of active...if the

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
current path, which is the current URL, is
equal to or starts with "slug," and that

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will just give it that highlighted look,
that we're going to be able,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
once we have these other pages, we'll
click on it in the current page...

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We'll click on it. Now, that helpers is
great, so that's kind of where you would

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
put it, but how does that happen? I just
made this helpers file.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:18.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Well, let's go back to our app.js...let's
go to about line 54 or so...this is a

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
concept called middleware, which we're
going to learn about it,

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but essentially what it allows us to do is
say, "on every single request,

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
put the information in the locals."

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Remember I said that these variables that
get passed, "name," "dog," and "title,"

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
those get put into something called
locals, but you can also put stuff on on

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
every single render. So we say,
"res.locals.h"... I just call it "h" for

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
brevity inside of my template..."=
helpers". Now where did helpers come from?

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Helpers got required at the very top. So
what's happening here is that inside of

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this file, we export "moment," and "dump,"
and "staticMap," and we're going to learn

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
exactly what all these things
are..."siteName," and then we go into our

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
app and we import it into a variable
called helpers, and then we simply give

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that information to our helpers every
single time that we need it.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:25.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, that's different than the
variables.env, because this is all

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sensitive information that probably
shouldn't make its way into our templating

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in any way, but everything in our helpers
is stuff that is not sensitive, and it

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
doesn't need to be an environmental
variable. It just needs to be in a file

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
somewhere so that we can pull it into each
of our templates. So you can do that with

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
arrays, you can do that with strings, or
you can also do that with entire libraries

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you like to use.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So one library that I really like to use
is called moment.js, and what moment.js

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
will do is it'll give you this nice date
formatting, and it will give you relative

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
time, like "this was five years ago,"
"this was in 11 hours." So what you could

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
do is if you're in your hello.pug, we can
simply use that variable,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:21.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we could say something like... I have an
h2 tag, "Sale ends in," and then we just

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
run a little bit of Javascript with our
pound...whoops! And "h's" are helpers,

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so everything is sort of under the
umbrella of h, dot, and then we have

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"moment," and we can just start using the
Javascript library from then.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we can say, ".endOf"...let's say the
sale ends at the end of the day,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we want to know how soon is that? So
we say, "fromNow."

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:53.870 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then go back here, and it's going to
say, "Sale ends in 11 hours." So rather

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:00.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
than have to compute that all inside of my
route, sometimes I like to just pass a

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
timestamp from here, and then in my
layout.pug or in my hello.pug,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.603 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm able to use these helper libraries
to format the date in a way that

00:06:12.603 --> 00:06:16.546 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I wish to have. And the way
that you surface a helper library is

00:06:16.546 --> 00:06:20.421 line:100% position:50% align:middle
by putting it in your helpers.js.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.800 line:100% position:50% align:middle
