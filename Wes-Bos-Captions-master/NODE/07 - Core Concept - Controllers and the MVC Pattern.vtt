00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.640 line:100% position:50% align:middle
This video we're going to learn about what
controllers are. And in order for us to

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
understand what a controller is, we
need to talk about the MVC pattern,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
so I've made this little graph
or chart, it's not a graph, it's a chart.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I made you this amazing chart and it sort
of explains the design pattern that we're

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.030 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be using. A design pattern is a
way that you architect your code and a way

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.886 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that you organize your code. So here we
have a model which is the M, we've got

00:00:39.886 --> 00:00:44.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
view, which is the V, and the controller
which is the C. So the V, we've already

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.234 line:100% position:50% align:middle
done, the View, that's our templates,
that's our pug files that we actually

00:00:48.234 --> 00:00:54.299 line:100% position:50% align:middle
template everything else out in. The
model is going to be the code that we

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:58.509 line:100% position:50% align:middle
write in the data that is
stored that accesses the database.

00:00:58.509 --> 00:01:01.805 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if we need to query
the top 10 stores or we need to find

00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:06.332 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stores that have a specific tag or we
need to pull reviews that are related

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:11.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to a store or we need to
get a list of stores that are within 10

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
kilometers of the latitude or longitude.
So all of those queries, all of that

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stuff that interacts with fetching data
from our database, that's our model layer

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we're going to go into that. Then we
have a view layer which, is our templates.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then the sort of the traffic cop in
between the model and the view,

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because it got to get data and put it
into a template. So the person that or

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the thing that gets the data and puts it
into a template is called the controller.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.947 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And I like to think of the controller
as just like traffic cop sort of

00:01:40.947 --> 00:01:43.985 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sitting in the middle and saying,
"Hey model, give me some data."

00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:46.185 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It pulls it back, and
then once it has the data,

00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:51.530 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it sends it over to the view. So
if we were to think of...I always love

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.039 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stupid ways to relate it to life. You
know, if you have friends, many of you do,

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you might have one of those friends in
your group that's always organizing

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
everything. So you want to have a party,
you might have friends who have alcohol

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.851 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and snacks, that would be your model. You
might have friends that have a place to

00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:15.490 line:100% position:50% align:middle
party, maybe they know a good restaurant
or maybe they have a house that you can go

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to, that would be your view. But those two
people can't get along together because

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
they're just totally useless. They've got
the goods but they can't get along.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you always have that one friend that's
texting everybody and making Facebook

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
events and sort of in between and
making sure that it all comes together,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.739 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that's what the controller is.
It has to be an examples here.

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.358 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if we look at this
code here, you'll see that

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:44.724 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we have written all of this logic
and we've directly tied it to a route.

00:02:44.724 --> 00:02:49.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And that, after you've build a
large application can get really really

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
messy, it can be really hard to test. It's
not reusable at all, because like what

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.875 line:100% position:50% align:middle
happens if you wanted to do similar or the
same code on a different route? Like

00:02:58.875 --> 00:03:05.057 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"/hello" then you'll have to like copy
paste the code? No. So what we do is we

00:03:05.057 --> 00:03:10.376 line:100% position:50% align:middle
factor this code out into its
own controller. If you open up

00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:12.878 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your file system here,
and you'll see we have a folder

00:03:12.878 --> 00:03:15.345 line:100% position:50% align:middle
called controllers, that's
where all of our controllers are going to

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
live. And generally, I like to create a
controller for every specific area of the

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
website, so we'll have a controller for
dealing with stores, creating and finding

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
them, we'll have a controller for dealing
with the users, we'll have a controller

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
for dealing with the reviews and surely
each specific part of your application

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
each functional part of your
application will have its own controller.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So we'll open that up, we'll make
a new file. I'm going to call it store

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.726 line:100% position:50% align:middle
controller, I like to camel case them
.JS. And then we have to export all of

00:03:47.726 --> 00:03:53.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the different functions that happen. Now
again, a controller is just this part of

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.795 line:100% position:50% align:middle
our actual code, so we can go
into here and on our exports variable.

00:03:58.795 --> 00:04:02.133 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So exports is sort of a global
variable, and anything that you put

00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:07.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on the exports variable will
be importable in another file.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So with the exports., and we'll call this
home page because this is going to handle

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whenever someone requests a home page and
we'll set that to be an error function.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Here, we have our requests, we have our
response and then we will simply just say

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:29.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
res.render our index file. Then we'll go
into our index. JS and we can get rid of

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.171 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all this, joking around here. So what
have we done? We have rendered our gate/

00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:40.082 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then we need to give it our
controller function here. So first thing

00:04:40.082 --> 00:04:44.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we need to do is import it. Say
cons store controller equals. And then

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.264 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to require
dot full slash, because it's a relative

00:04:48.264 --> 00:04:52.428 line:100% position:50% align:middle
file into our controllers file.
Oh, we actually know we need

00:04:52.428 --> 00:04:55.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to go up because
what file are we in right now?

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're on the route, so we go upper level
into our controllers and then get our

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:05.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
store controller . Well here, we'll say
<i>store controller.</i> and then what was the

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
method we made? Our home page, .Homepage.
And what this does is it will then take

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:21.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this function here and we will essentially
just copy and paste it into here,

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But now that code is not directly tied to
the route. It's just tied to being its own

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
function and we can pull that out
and put it, attach it to any route that we

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
want at any time. Now, if you were to try
and refresh this, we're going to see an

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
error here. As you can see fail to look at
views index in views directory. And that's

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.142 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because we haven't created our index file
yet, right? We're trying to render index

00:05:45.142 --> 00:05:49.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but we haven't yet passed it anything. So
we'll go to our views directory. We'll

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.867 line:100% position:50% align:middle
create a new file named
<i>index.pug</i> and if we just

00:05:52.867 --> 00:05:55.883 line:100% position:50% align:middle
put a paragraph that says,
"Hi, in there." And refresh,

00:05:55.883 --> 00:05:59.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
now you'll see that as rendering out
our index.pug file. Now that's not good

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
enough. We want that extends the layout
and we want to make, how did you...hi in

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
there whenever we have
a block called content inside of that.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We invent at one level
for our paragraph, so see how

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're doing there. There
we go. Now it's showing up. We

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have our high, we've got the rest of our
page being laid out. So generally how it's

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.017 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to work, and this is how we are
going to have it. It is our route file,

00:06:23.017 --> 00:06:29.304 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is simply just going to tell us what
the URLs that we hit are, and then we will

00:06:29.304 --> 00:06:35.381 line:100% position:50% align:middle
always shell it off to a separate file to
do the actual work. So we always

00:06:35.381 --> 00:06:38.931 line:100% position:50% align:middle
shell off the work to a store controller
and sometimes we're going to multiple

00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:42.244 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in here, which is what we're going
to learn next. It's called <i>Middleware</i>.

00:06:42.244 --> 00:06:44.757 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's it. Let's
jump on to the next one.
