00:00:12.043 --> 00:00:15.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
All right. Let's talk about <i>Deployment.</i>
How do I get this on the internet so

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
other people can actually go ahead and
start using it? Well, what we need to do

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
first is get a couple of things setup
before we can move into any of the

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
different ways that I could possibly
deploy in. Most of these ways that you

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
deploy is having a git-repo.
Even if it's not deploying via git,

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
having a git-repo is a great idea. So you
might already have a git-repo or you might

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
not. And if you have already
cloned this one from GitHub, then great.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You already have a git-repo.
We'll talk about that in just a second.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Don't skip this part because there's an
important part we're going to have here.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
But if you don't, you do
getting it, and I made a new git-repo.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.810 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then, we also want to make a gitignore
file. So we're going to right-click on our

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.007 line:100% position:50% align:middle
project and make a new file
called, .<i>gitignore</i>. And inside

00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:04.066 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of your gitignore,
we're going to write some files

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that need to be
ignored, both by git as well as some

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of these other deployment things also use
your<i> gitignore</i> to tell it what not to

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually upload. So if you are coming from
an existing gitignore that you've cloned

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.404 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from GitHub, it will look like this.
There you'll see something similar to

00:01:20.404 --> 00:01:24.489 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this, no modules, DS store,
log, idea, haters, variables and ENV,

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:27.517 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and some of that stuff. So what
is this? Well, you don't want to put

00:01:27.517 --> 00:01:29.288 line:100% position:50% align:middle
your node modules up on GitHub, it's huge.

00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:34.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can always get that by NPM
installing. DS store is just a Mac OS X

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
file. Log is a log file that something
might put onto your system that doesn't go

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
into it. Ideas for weird people that use
like <i>WebStorm</i> or something like that.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Haters, just don't have them. And
then we have our variables like ENV file.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Why? Because your variables like ENV file
should never, ever, ever go on any sort of

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.587 line:100% position:50% align:middle
version control because what you get is,
it is specific to the system that you're

00:01:55.587 --> 00:01:59.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on. Then I also did this little trickery
to make sure that you could download a

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hill-bunch of files by default.
But if you were to add upload files,

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it would not go in there. Now, if we're
deploying, we actually need to get rid of

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.630 line:100% position:50% align:middle
all of this here. So just
select all that, get rid of that. So,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you do not have a gitignore, now
you do, and if you did have a gitignore,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.597 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it looks exactly like this.
One last thing, actually, we want to put

00:02:17.597 --> 00:02:21.285 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variables.env.now, and
I'll talk about that when we hit the

00:02:21.285 --> 00:02:23.532 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the now deployment
videos as well, but make sure

00:02:23.532 --> 00:02:27.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you add both of those. Good.
Then you can go over here and type

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Git status, and there's going to be all
kinds of stuff. We don't have it hooked up

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to GitHub or anything like that just yet.
That's fine. What we'll do is to git add

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.360 line:100% position:50% align:middle
everything, git commit -m call up, and
then we are up and running as they get

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
status. You can double-check
that. Everything is good. All right.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's what we have now.
Next up what we need to do is to get,

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
sort of all of our variables in order. If
we open up our variables.env file,

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to need...and don't change
this one just yet because this is for your

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
local development. But you're
going to need a version of all of these.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That's going to be called<i> Production</i>. Your
database needs to be...either you can use

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the existing database that you've had, if
that data is up, or if you have this as

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like a test database and you also want a
production database. I recommend that you

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.950 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go ahead and create a second database if
that's the case. So I'm going to be using

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Mlab here just because I host all my
database with them. I'm really happy with

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it but you can use any other service. Or
if you're wise enough to create your own

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
local database on your
server, then you can go ahead and do that.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I should caution you that if you are going
to create your own MongoDB database,

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I know I've said this a few times but you
must set a username and password.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.770 line:100% position:50% align:middle
By default, MongoDB does not come with a
username and password and you'll get

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.229 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hacked. Then you have a
mail user host port. I'm a big fan

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:57.832 line:100% position:50% align:middle
of using something called <i>Postmark</i>.
And Postmark is all these services

00:03:57.832 --> 00:04:00.650 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that provide what
is called <i>Transactional email</i>

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where they just send one email at a time
and you need a service to actually do

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.570 line:100% position:50% align:middle
this. So Postmark have, I think they have
like 10,000 free, something like that,

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or you signup you get a whole bunch of it
for free, and then it's just pennies to

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.662 line:100% position:50% align:middle
send once past that. So there's
also like, SendGrid, MailGun, Mailbird,

00:04:19.662 --> 00:04:21.880 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I don't know. There's a whole
bunch of them. Postmark has been...

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I've tried them all out and
I'm really happy with Postmark. Port,

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you're going to want to change
that to 80 once we actually deploy it.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Again, we'll see that. Map key, go ahead
and get your own Google maps key if you

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
don't have one already. Otherwise, I don't
know, you could probably keep that one

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
until it stops working so we're going
to slash. We can leave those as it is.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, don't, again, don't change any
variables in here but you just need to

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
know that you have to have all this stuff
ready before you go ahead and start

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.690 line:100% position:50% align:middle
deploying unless you just want to get it
like up and running and you're not

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually worried about the mail.
Then you can leave it as your mail drop.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Finally, we need to make some changes to
our package .JSON that we have up and

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
running. So we have our pride, watch
start, assets, sample, blow it all away.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You saw another one called <i>Node</i>
down here, I've switched how that works.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.865 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I've taken that out. But what most of
these things do is they actually run the

00:05:11.865 --> 00:05:16.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
npm start command in order to actually
start it for us. And we were using the npm

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.563 line:100% position:50% align:middle
start command to run concurrently
watch, as well as run this assets,

00:05:21.563 --> 00:05:23.797 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we don't need to
either of those on our server.

00:05:23.797 --> 00:05:25.773 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We don't need
to watch it because we're not

00:05:25.773 --> 00:05:28.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
actually actively developing it. We are
going to use something called <i>Forever</i>

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
though. And then we also don't need to
care about, assets because we're not

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
recompiling it. We don't use a compiler or
javascript or anything on this server.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:41.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, what start should be renamed to is
called,<i> dev.</i> And now, let me just tell

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you, if you ever want to just
run it now locally, it's not npm start,

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's npm run dev. And that's how you're
actually going to run your application

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
from here on out. So you see it just
kicked up and now is running for me.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.159 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to kill that. And
then, there's also this one called<i> Pride</i>,

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:02.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I want you to rename that to start. Why?
Because that's how you actually start your

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
application normally without any of this,
like, run, watch, and assets and web pack

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.171 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and everything. We just want to start
our application. It's just as simple as

00:06:10.171 --> 00:06:16.691 line:100% position:50% align:middle
calling node start.js. Okay, cool. So
we've done that and now let's get in to

00:06:16.691 --> 00:06:19.886 line:100% position:50% align:middle
moving some of the actual
different deployment scenarios.
