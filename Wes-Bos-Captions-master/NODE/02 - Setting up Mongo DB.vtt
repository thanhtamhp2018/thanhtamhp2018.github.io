00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.430 line:100% position:50% align:middle
All of the data for our application is
going to be stored in MongoDB.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Which is a type of database, fairly
popular in the node community.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now, in order to get a database up
and running, we have two options:

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.070 line:100% position:50% align:middle
First, we can use a database as a service,
as a DBaaS, or we can use MongoDB and

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.720 line:100% position:50% align:middle
host it ourselves. So, what I'm
going to show you to do first is,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.210 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to use a hosted service.
Then I will show you how you can run it

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
yourself. So, I'm a big fan, and this is
what I use for all of my own database

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
hosting. It's called mLab, mlab.com. And
they provide the database hosting for you,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and they have a really good free plan,
which is when you're just working on

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.980 line:100% position:50% align:middle
development, that's exactly what you need.
So go to mlab.com, and create an account,

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and there's also, I should just tell you,
that MongoDB themselves has a new

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
service called Atlas, which will allow
you to build a free database as well.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You don't need to put a credit card in
or anything like that. It's brand new,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's experiencing some outage. It's been a
little slow for me, so I'm not going to be

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
showing you how to do that, but I bet in
the next couple of months it's going to

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
show up and look pretty good. So we're
going to go over to MongoDB deployments.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to create a new one. You can
pick out where you'd like to store it.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to pick AWS, East one, that's
kind of where I host a lot of my

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
stuff. You've got to click on single
node and scroll all the way down to

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
where it says Sandbox Shared 0.5. Then you
need to pick the version of MongoDB that

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you're going to be running on. 3.2.x is
just fine as long as you're on at least

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that. We're going to be using
some stuff that uses that today.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.260 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And then the database name, we're
going to call that dang_thats_delicious.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.150 line:100% position:50% align:middle
That will then create our MongoDB
deployment and it's going to

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
take just a second to set up. Once
that's set up, you can click on through to

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it, and we need to figure out what our
connection string is. So, what I want you

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to do is open up your files here,
and you'll see that we have this

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:26.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variables.m.sample. I want to open
that up and rename it variables.env.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Take the .sample off of that, and this
database, this is where we need

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.990 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to specify the connection to
our MongoDB. So we have

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:44.451 line:100% position:50% align:middle
mongodb://user:password@host.com/port
/database, and that's actually what they

00:02:44.451 --> 00:02:49.704 line:100% position:50% align:middle
provide with us here. So go ahead and copy
that out and put that connection string in

00:02:49.704 --> 00:02:53.500 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right there. Now, that's not it so far. We
also need to put in the username and the

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
password for our database. So,
it's really important that you create it.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you host your own MongoDB, some
of them will not give you by default.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It will not have a username and password
which is a huge security flaw.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So you want to make sure that you always
create a username and a password for it.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
MongoDB on mLab by default is going to
have it. So we're going to go over to

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.520 line:100% position:50% align:middle
users. We're going to add a database
user. We're going to call it dang.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to make the password dang, and
I'm going to convert it as dang.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Obviously make yours more secure than
this, but that's what I'm working with

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.140 line:100% position:50% align:middle
right now. I'm going to create and we're
going to go back to our thing here,

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm going to take out, including the
angle brackets here. The username is

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be dang, a colon and then the
password is going to be dang. And that's

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.560 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to allow us connect to it. The way
that we can tell if this has worked is

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're going to try to connect to our
database with what's called a MongoDB

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
GUI. And what a GUIwill allow us to
do is to log in to the database and

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
visualize all the data that we have.
Often, a GUI will allow you to update,

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
create new data, edit existing data.
If you've ever used something

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like PHPMyAdmin for mysql database. This
is sort of similar. There's all kinds of

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle
GUIs out there, but we're going to be
using one called MongoDB Compass.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.670 line:100% position:50% align:middle
And if you do a quick Google search for a
MongoDB Compass, you go ahead and

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
download, I suggest you go on the latest
beta. What ever version is current at the

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
time of you watching this, and then
select whichever platform you're on,

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
download it, install it to your computer.
Now, I want you to go ahead and copy this

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
whole query string that we have here
MongoDB, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.340 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Go over to your MongoDB Compass
beta, open it up. It's going to

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.290 line:100% position:50% align:middle
automatically detect that I had copied it.
I'm going to say Yes and what that will do

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.860 line:100% position:50% align:middle
is it's going to automatically populate
the hostname, the port, the way that we're

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
connecting, in this case, we're using
a username and a password,

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the database that we wish to connect to,
and that's all that we got.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.400 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So go ahead and click on Connect, and if
that has worked, then you will see that we

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.732 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have connected to our dang-thats-delicious
database, and that's all we're going to

00:05:02.732 --> 00:05:06.110 line:100% position:50% align:middle
see for now. But we're going to
come back to this GUI when we

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have created different data in here, where
we're going to be able to visualize what

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we have. So that's the very easiest
way to get set up with MongoDB.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.890 line:100% position:50% align:middle
If you just want to keep going with this
tutorial, stop right here and jump to the

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
next video. Now, if you're going to be
doing this tutorial on an airplane,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.060 line:100% position:50% align:middle
or a train, or somewhere that just does
not have an internet connection,

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.190 line:100% position:50% align:middle
what we're going to need to do is install
MongoDB on your actual computer.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'm on a Mac here and the
easiest way to install on a Mac is first

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you need something called Homebrew. If
you don't have that go take a look at

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
that. There's tons of tutorials out there,
and you simply just type brew update to go

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and grab the latest definitions. If you're
already up to date it will say up to date,

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and then you do brew install MongoDB, and
what that will do is it will go off an

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.020 line:100% position:50% align:middle
install all of the things that you
need. You can tell if you have it

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
installed properly when
you type mongo - - version,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.691 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and when you hit that you're going to see,
you should be on at least version 3.4 or I

00:06:09.691 --> 00:06:14.540 line:100% position:50% align:middle
guess we are on 3.2 as well. Those
versions are just fine for us.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.410 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Now how do we actually start up
MongoDB when we are connected?

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.850 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can get it started by typing mongod,
but you probably will need to put a sudo

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.510 line:100% position:50% align:middle
in front of it if you're on an OS X. When
you hit enter it might ask you for your

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
password, but this will have it up and
running. There's other commands

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.840 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can use to sort of open it
and run it in a background task,

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but I prefer to just to leave it open in a
tab running, open up a fresh tab and have

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
MongoDB working. Now, can we test that
that works? We'll go back to our MongoDB

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.310 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Compass here. I don't want to connect to
the string that's in my copy paste,

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.350 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but here, we want to connect to the local
host. By default, the port is 27017.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.220 line:100% position:50% align:middle
There's no authentication locally, so
you can leave it on all of these here.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Go ahead and click connect and
you're going to see, In this case, it's

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to show me all the different
databases that I have locally.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You see that I have dang_thats_delicious
just from one that I've done before.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.100 line:100% position:50% align:middle
We're going to go ahead and create our own
database here, but you'll know your local

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.590 line:100% position:50% align:middle
host is connected and then we'll be
able to hear... This is kind of a look at

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.946 line:100% position:50% align:middle
how it looks. We're going to have
information about the authors. We're

00:07:17.946 --> 00:07:21.420 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to have descriptions. We're going to
have geolocation data that gets stored.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
You can see all around the city,
these dots are popping up. Names,

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.280 line:100% position:50% align:middle
images, etc, and I can look at the
documents, then you'll notice that this

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
looks just exactly like a javascript
object. Which is exactly how we're

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:43.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be working with MongoDB. If
you are on Windows, let me go over to

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
mongodb.com, and click on download
in the top right-hand corner.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Select the latest version for your
current version of Windows,

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and download that. It's going
to ask you for some information,

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
but it's not necessary to put it in,
because you'll see it's already

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:01.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
downloading. Once that download
has finished, open it up,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.955 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go through next, next, next. It's just
going to ask you which version you'd like

00:08:05.955 --> 00:08:20.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to install, and click on complete. Once
it's installed, go to C:, Program Files,

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.151 line:100% position:50% align:middle
MongoDB, Server, the current version and
then bin. In there you're going to see all

00:08:23.151 --> 00:08:27.000 line:100% position:50% align:middle
the applications that we need, and the
one we're looking for is mongod,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
M-O-N-G-O-D, and that's going to
run the database locally on our

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
computer. Now, to run it, open up your
command and move into that folder,

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:43.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So, here I'm going to go into Program
Files, into MongoDB, then into the Server

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:50.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
folder, current version, and then bin.
And to run it, we're going to type simply

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.722 line:100% position:50% align:middle
M-O-N-G-O-D. Now, when you get this,
you might get an error that says data

00:08:55.722 --> 00:09:01.230 line:100% position:50% align:middle
directory, data db not found, terminating,
and that's because MongoDB needs a folder

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:08.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on your C:/Data and a folder called db, in
order to actually store the data that's

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:13.370 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to be saved to our db. So create
that folder, try run the mongod command

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:22.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
again, and you are up and running. You can
go to your MongoDB Compass, you should

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.796 line:100% position:50% align:middle
be able to connect with
the default settings.
