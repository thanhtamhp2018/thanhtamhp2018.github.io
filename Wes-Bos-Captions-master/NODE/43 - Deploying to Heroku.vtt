00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.123 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Next we're going to
be looking at how do

00:00:13.123 --> 00:00:17.330 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we deploy our application to Heroku.
Heroku is pretty popular in the Ruby

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.600 line:100% position:50% align:middle
community, but it turns out they actually
do host, like, PHP, and Node,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.680 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and you name it. You'll be able to host
all kinds of different apps.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's pretty simple to get up and
running. It's Git-based which is pretty

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.160 line:100% position:50% align:middle
nice as well. So we want to go and create
a Heroku account, sign into your dashboard

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.320 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you don't already have one, and create
new app from that dropdown.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.740 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Then we're going to create an app called
here, "Now That's Delicious" and it's

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to say it's available. Obviously
don't call yours "Now That's Delicious"

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.440 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because I just took it. Go ahead and click
this button, "Create App," and that's

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.930 line:100% position:50% align:middle
going to spin up a little server for us.
Now what you need to do before you even

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.361 line:100% position:50% align:middle
get going is you have to install the
Heroku CLI, which will give us a command

00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:03.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
like this, Heroku, and that will allow us
to run our actual commands from there.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.920 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So if you do not already have that
installed, just go ahead and grab the

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
latest installer for whatever you're
running. Ideally, you're on OSX and you

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
can just run brew install Heroku. If
you're on Windows, it looks like they have

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
a nice little next, next, next installer,
and I guess on OSX they even have a nice

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
little next, next, next installer. If
you're on Linux, then good luck to you.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.450 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I'm joking, if you're on Linux you know
how to copy paste these commands.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
Anyway, once you are there, go ahead and
run Heroku login via your terminal.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.633 line:100% position:50% align:middle
It's going to ask you for your username
and your password, and then you will be

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:44.010 line:100% position:50% align:middle
logged in on your terminal as Heroku.
Then, we want to go into our existing Git

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.176 line:100% position:50% align:middle
application, so it looks like right now, I
changed my package.json so I'm just going

00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:55.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
to add that real quick. Good, so I am up
to date. And the way you can tell if

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.080 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you're up to date if you don't have a
snazzy thing like me, you just say "Git

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
status" and you are up to date. Good.
Next, what you want to do is,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
if you have an existing Git repo, which we
do, you simply just take this,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.820 line:100% position:50% align:middle
don't copy the dollar sign, and paste that
in there. Git remote,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:20.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
"Now That's Delicious," and what it did is
it created a remote on your Git repo that

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.390 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can then push to actually get. So all
we have to do now is make sure we've

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.910 line:100% position:50% align:middle
added and committed, which we have because
we're in green, and then you simply git

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.644 line:100% position:50% align:middle
push Heroku master. And how this works is
that you're going to have, like, GitHub or

00:02:35.644 --> 00:02:39.405 line:100% position:50% align:middle
GitLab, or whatever it is that you're
pushing your git code to, but then you can

00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:45.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
also do a git push to Heroku and also have
your application up and running on that.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.730 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So I'm going to give that a push and it's
going to actually upload everything that I

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.700 line:100% position:50% align:middle
have. This will take a little bit since we
have all of those different images that

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.940 line:100% position:50% align:middle
need to be uploaded. While we're waiting
for that, we didn't yet talk about

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:05.580 line:100% position:50% align:middle
environmental variables. And there is no
way to include files in Heroku but not

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.470 line:100% position:50% align:middle
include them in git, so what we need to do
for our environmental variables is to set

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.710 line:100% position:50% align:middle
them via our dashboard. So I think we can
go to settings, and you see "config

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.900 line:100% position:50% align:middle
variables." This is the exact same thing
as having a variables.env file, but

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
we're actually running it via the
dashboard. So we'll say "reveal." There is

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:34.460 line:100% position:50% align:middle
none. And what I'll need you to do now is
to go to your variables.env file and just

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.040 line:100% position:50% align:middle
go ahead and move them all over. I'm going
to move my .now ones over because that's

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.380 line:100% position:50% align:middle
my production-ready ones. So the key is
going to be node end, take the equals off,

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.852 line:100% position:50% align:middle
and we just need to go one by one by one
pasting all of these over.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.830 line:100% position:50% align:middle
All right, I got them all up and running,
let's go back to our terminal and see how

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:10.610 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's going. Looks like it just did it and
it says "deploy to Heroku." You can click

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.750 line:100% position:50% align:middle
on it and we might be able to see our app.
We'll see. There we go,

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.960 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it's up and running. What might happen is
if your app tries to start before you're

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.970 line:100% position:50% align:middle
done with these environmental variables in
the back end, then it's going to crash

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.780 line:100% position:50% align:middle
because it can't find these environmental
variables. So if that's the case,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.480 line:100% position:50% align:middle
you can go to your app, and you can
restart all dinos and what that will do is

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.620 line:100% position:50% align:middle
it'll just kill your app and try to
restart it with the npm start

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.598 line:100% position:50% align:middle
command again.

00:04:37.598 --> 00:04:41.200 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that was very simple again, so we've
got our stores here, you'll be able to

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.090 line:100% position:50% align:middle
click through to everything, log in no
problem with all that up and running.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.300 line:100% position:50% align:middle
So that's two of sort of these really
simple hosting, now let's look at how we

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.250 line:100% position:50% align:middle
can actually do it with Digital Ocean,
which is sort of you got to build your

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.666 line:100% position:50% align:middle
own server and get a little more
dirty while you're doing it.

00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:59.666 line:100% position:50% align:middle
